\item [2007 --] \textbf{Software Engineer, Google Inc.}  Freigutstrasse 12, CH-8002 Zürich, Switzerland

As an engineer on the Google Maps team, I develop the next-generation technologies that change how millions interact, making the world's information about places in the real world accessible and useful to users. I use ideas from every area of computer science, including information retrieval, artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing, distributed computing, large-scale system design, networking, security, data compression and user interface design to handle information at the scale of the interface between the web and the real world.

\item [2006 -- 2007] \textbf{Research Assistant, Deutsche Forschungszentrum für Künstliche Intelligenz}  Stuhlsatzenhausweg 3 (Gebäude D3 2)
D-66123 Saarbrücken, Germany

I worked as a research assistant (wissenschaftliche Hilfskraft) at the German research center for AI (DFKI) in the VirtualHuman group, developing software tools for creating, deploying and evaluating the embodied agents ("Virtual Human") developed by the group.

\item [2006] \textbf{Software Engineer, Defence Science and Technology Organisation}  506 Lorimer St, Fishermans Bend VIC 3207, Australia

From January until March I worked as a graduate software engineer in the Air Operations Simulations Center in the Defence Science and Technology Organisation.  The Air Operations Simulations Center operates a facility in which cutting-edge technology is used to produce a realistic flying environment for human-in-the-loop simulation experiments.  The facility conducts research into aerospace operations requirements and equipment suitability for Australian Defence aerospace operations.

\item [2005] \textbf{Tutor, Ormond College}  College Crescent, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia

During the second semester of 2005, I tutored a group of first year students at Ormond College who were taking the subject `Electrical Circuits'.  In their end-of-term feedback, the students wrote that I `helped [them] to raise questions, express uncertainties and participate fully', and that the tutorials were `stimulating and thought provoking'.

\item [2004 -- 2005] \textbf{Software Engineering Project and Advanced Software Engineering Project}  

As part of my Software Engineering degree at the University of Melbourne, I participated in two industrial projects.  In the first, I was in a team of 5 software engineers who developed a software package for researchers in the Optics group in the School of Physics at Melbourne University.  For the second, I was in a team of 15 software engineers who developed a software package for researchers in the Department of Information Systems at Melbourne University.  In each project, We conducted all of the activities of the software and project lifecycle, including planning and managing the software process, requirements elicitation, documentation, requirements analysis, specification, design, implementation and testing.  As part of both projects, we were required to communicate effectively both with each other and with the client, and undertake a variety of leadership positions during the course of the project.  As technical manager and Executive Officer of the first team, my tasks included training the other team members in the tools and software used during the project, supervising team ``work sessions'', and setting and monitoring weekly team goals and objectives; as quality assurance manager and build manager in the second team, my tasks included setting quality objectives for our product, developing, documenting, monitoring and improving quality  processes for our team, and overseeing and managing the tasks and schedule for the final build of our software system.

\item [2001 -- 2005] \textbf{IT Administrator, Ormond College}  College Crescent, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia

I worked in the IT administration department at Ormond College, first as Assistant IT Administrator in 2001, then as IT Administrator from 2002 onwards. As well as administering a network consisting of several Linux servers, a computer room of 15 Windows NT/2000 workstations, 15 employee Windows workstations and a variable number of student workstations (Windows, Mac and Linux), I participated in the planning and implementation of an LDAP-based authentication and mail routing system, and later in the planning and implementation of a full network hardware upgrade from 10Mbps unswitched to 1Gbps backbone and 100Mbps to the desktop, fully switched, including the extension of the LAN to include a number of terrace houses in the surrounding suburbs owned by Ormond College.

\item [Summer 1999, 2000] \textbf{Laboratory Assistant, Rohm and Haas Australia Pty. Ltd.}  Hays Road, Point Henry, Geelong, VIC 3220, Australia

During the 1999/2000 and 2000/2001 summer holidays, I worked for Rohm and Haas Australia Pty Ltd in their Geelong Technical Centre. I assisted industrial chemists with research and technical service projects, working at the cutting edge of paint technology.
