<h1>Martin's Affective Agent</h1>
<p>Here is the webpage for the agent.  You can:
<ul>
<li><a href=report.pdf>Read the report</a></li>
<li><a href=poster.ppt>See the poster</a> - warning, 1.3Mb file.  My sincerest
apologies for the format.  We were given a template; we had to use it.  If
anyone has the facilities to convert this into something more reader-friendly
(such as pdf), I'd love to <a href=mailto:martin@ockle.org>hear from you</a>.
</li>
<li><a href=agent.cgi>Start the agent</a>.  Note that the first time you load
the page it does not finish loading.  This is what happens when a CGI script
puts something in the background.  Don't ask me why.  When you see the raw
output appear at the bottom of the screen (below the 'interface'), then the
script has finished running (even if your browser is still spinning).  You may
happily proceed.  After the first time loading, all pages will finish loading
correctly.  Note also that your session will time out after 10 minutes.  I
don't want tons of stray Prolog processes slowing down what is already an
elderly server.</li>
</ul>
