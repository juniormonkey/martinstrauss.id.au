Of course, it is not easy to walk for about 1 and a half hour a day. So, if you walk for average 30 minutes more than usual, you will walk nearly 10 thousand steps a day including the steps that required for a daily activity. To help for understanding, it is as belows;<br /><br />A. Daily caloric intake from foods is 2,500~3,000Kcalorie.<br />B. Metabolic consuming calory is approximates 1,500Kcalorie.<br />C. For the remaining 1,500Kcal, you would consume by exercise.<br />D. In the case of salaried man, intake energy is remains 300Kcal compares to consume energy of daily life.<br />* If you walk 10,000 steps, can consume 30 calories. The basis is as following. : There is the person who is 65kgs.<br />- The person want to consume 1 calorie, he has to walk 30 steps.<br />- General people's step is 65cm, And if he walk 100 steps per minute, he can walk 3.9km/h. So, If he walk 90 minutes, he can consume 30 calories. But, women can consume 90% of men's consumptive calories.<br /><br />The Using Method<br />1. Please put it on the waist belt.<br />2. Push the bottom of 'CLEAR' which is left side of product. It is going to set up '00000' after pushing the bottom.<br />3. If you want to change a unit, just push the MODE bottom.<br />4. You can check your consumptive calorie and km of Miles (distance) per volume of exercise if you push the MODE bottom.<br /><br />Caution<br />1. Do not drop it, or give a shock.<br />2. Do not make to wet or soak by water.<br />3. Please put it on correcitly when you put it on a belt, (reference the picture)<br /><br />The method of battery exchange<br />1. Open the cover and separate it.<br />2. Push out the battery by any pointed thing and than exchange it.<br />&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br /><br />Well, that clears that up.<br /><br /></td></tr>

Or... are you simply a techie with too much time on your hands? <br /><br />Google looks forward to hosting a competition for university students in East Africa. Participants from Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi and Ethiopia can design and build gadgets and win prizes. Gadgets are small, simple applications that run on web pages. There are gadgets for easy email access, gadgets for football results, gadgets for fun and gadgets for frivolity. They're simple to develop, given some knowledge of HTML (and ideally XML and Javascript too). And they're easy to distribute – through iGoogleTM (Google's personalised homepage), platforms such as OpenSocial(TM) and third-party websites. There are tens of millions of people who use gadgets globally, generating billions of gadget pageviews per week! <br /><br />The competition will run between February and June 2008, with more details (including a dedicated competition website and explanation of terms and restrictions) to follow in January.

<td class="left data  not_null   ">Zurich</td><td class="left data  not_null   ">Well, again I have let the weeds grow over this blog a little, but again I have a good excuse. &nbsp;I have been finishing a Masters thesis: &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.martinstrauss.id.au/misc/thesis_martinstrauss.pdf'&gt;Realtime generation of multimodal affective <br />sports commentary for embodied agents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. &nbsp;And since finishing this thesis mid-October, I have moved to Zürich, where I am Living The Dream (as a friend put it). &nbsp;Specifically, I am working as a software engineer for Google.<br /><br />Zürich is a beautiful city. &nbsp;Neutrality during two world wars, and other wars before and since, has a wonderfully preserving effect on heritage architecture. &nbsp;Also, the weather is beautiful here. &nbsp;Either it is sunny with blue skies, or it is snowing. &nbsp;Admittedly it is also very very cold, but I hide from that by staying in the heated indoors.<br /><br />The people here are on the whole lovely, although they speak a almost-entirely-incomprehensible language that somehow is also called German. &nbsp;(For my linguistically inclined readers, yes, it is blatantly obvious that the language is not context-free. &nbsp;Words come in the 'wrong' order.) &nbsp;But I am steadfastly watching Swiss television and trying to learn. &nbsp;Meanwhile, I am learning that it is better to be taken for an Australian than mistaken for a German. &nbsp;To make some gross generalisations, the Swiss (as a whole) can be rather unfortunately &lt;a href='http://www.focus.de/politik/ausland/schweizer-wahlkampf_aid_135875.html'&gt;hostile towards foreigners&lt;/a&gt;, but they seem to reserve a special level of distrust for Germans. &nbsp;Possibly this is due to the fact that the Germans (as a whole) tend to look down their noses at the Swiss - presumably out of jealousy that Switzerland has more money, better cheese, better chocolate and better skiing than Germany. &nbsp;But these are just my impressions after a few weeks here, and all the people I have met have been friendly and lovely and helpful and kind, which is something I have learnt not to take for granted.<br /><br />As far as working for Google goes, the Interblags have enough rumours and writing and whatever about that. &nbsp;All I will add is that it's all true. &nbsp;(Yes, &quot;20-percent-time&quot;, free food, on-site haircuts and massages, even the secret moon base.) &nbsp;A week ago I had a bit of a moment on the stairs, where I had to stop and think, wow, how many people all over the world wouldn't kill (or more!) to be right where I am now. &nbsp;This is cool. &nbsp;<br /><br />Last week Google launched &lt;a href='http://maps.google.ch'&gt;Google Maps Switzerland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href='http://maps.google.at'&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt; (oh, and &lt;a href='http://maps.google.li'&gt;Lichtenstein&lt;/a&gt;, natch) to great acclaim and media brouhaha. &nbsp;T-shirts all round. &nbsp;Finally I have one not in Extra-Extra-Large. &nbsp;(I have to learn to be more proactive about t-shirt sizes!)<br /><br />Thus far I have been living in a one-room corporate apartment while I searched for a permanent apartment. &nbsp;Finding an apartment in Zürich is remarkably difficult, especially if you're after the sort of one-bedroom, one-person apartment that seemingly everybody is looking for. &nbsp;But I shall cut a long story very short and just note that I now have an apartment, and I will be moving in on the 26th. &nbsp;Yesterday I went to Ikea to buy plates and bowls and knives and forks and pots and pans and things so that I won't starve (that sort of stuff is provided in this corporate apartment), and the removalists will deliver what little furniture I own to my new apartment when I move in, so I will have a bed on which to sleep. &nbsp;The next great adventure will consist of finding furniture. &nbsp;This corporate apartment is tiny, and the fridge is right next to the bed and gurgles at night, and the internet is so slow it could be the 1990s (well, not quite), and the cleaning ladies barge in en masse to change the sheets at inconvenient times, so I am greatly looking forward to moving into a place of my own.<br /><br />Well, we have had snow during the week, but now we have blue skies and sunshine, and the temperature is thinking about dipping above 0C, so perhaps it's time for me to wind up this epistle and head outside into the fresh air.</td></tr>

<td class="left data  not_null   ">Paris</td><td class="left data  not_null   ">I went to Paris last week. &nbsp;I have been delaying posting about it because (a) I wanted to wait for the photos to be developed, and (b) I have been writing a Masters Thesis, and if that doesn't count as Better Things To Do then I don't know what does. &nbsp;Regardless, the photos are now &lt;a href='http://www.ockle.org/photos/paris07/'&gt;uploaded&lt;/a&gt; and the thesis can handle a few minutes' break, so I shall pen a few lines to let everyone know I'm still alive.<br /><br />The excuse for Paris was the &lt;a href='http://iva07.ntua.gr/'&gt;7th International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents&lt;/a&gt;, in particular the &lt;a href='http://hmi.ewi.utwente.nl/gala/'&gt;Gathering of Animated Lifelike Agents&lt;/a&gt; at which ERIC (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ockle.org/blog/2007/05/20/id-like-you-all-to-meet-a-very-special-friend-of-mine/&quot; title=&quot;Permanent Link to I’d like you all to meet a very special friend of mine…&quot;&gt;remember him?&lt;/a&gt;) was competing. &nbsp;(Yes, he won a prize.)<br /><br />The other attraction to the whole experience (apart from Paris itself of course) was the experience of the new high-speed ICE, which I took in both directions. &nbsp;Thundering across Northern France at 300+ km/h is rather an experience. &nbsp;Also an experience is having the power cut out on the way home as we cross the German/French border, leaving us stranded for two hours 5 km/h out of Saarbrücken. &nbsp;Almost home! even with Saarbrücken buses driving along the road next to the track ... if you would only open the doors... But not to worry, we'll just try rebooting the train from scratch, sorry folks, this means even the emergency lighting will go out, it'll be pitch black for a while, please don't panic.<br /><br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br /><br />Oh, well, that didn't work. &nbsp;Never mind, we'll phone a train from Frankfurt to come and tow us into Saarbrücken. &nbsp;Sorry for the inconvenience. &nbsp;Szank yew for traffeling vis ze Deutsche Bahn.<br /><br />Regardless, the way to Paris was uneventful (give or take 15 minutes' delay leaving Saarbrücken ...), and at 300+ km/h you really do have to pinch yourself to remind yourself that you really are in Paris already, not just dreaming of it after falling asleep on the train somewhere around Metz. &nbsp;I stayed in a wonderful hostel/hotel in Montmartre called the &lt;a href='http://www.montclair-hostel.com/'&gt;Montclair&lt;/a&gt; which I have no reservations about recommending, it was clean and cheap and everything you expect from a hostel. &nbsp;Montmarte itself - and of course all of Paris - was also lovely, particularly around sunset. &nbsp;But you can see the photos for yourself.<br /><br />Since then I have been mainly writing away at this thesis. &nbsp;On Friday I went to Frankfurt to sort out some visa issues, and stayed overnight to see the AFL Grand Final at the Aussie Bar there, since the No Worries Australian Pub here in Saarbrücken had never heard of the AFL. &nbsp;(&quot;Grand what?&quot; &quot;please tell me you are joking&quot;) &nbsp;A nice change from all the other Geelong Grand Finals I've watched (to say the least...) &nbsp;I'm a bit far away from the festivities at home, but I'm wearing my vaguely blue-and-grey striped jumper proudly even if nobody here knows why it brings a grin to my face.<br /><br />Anyway, I'd better head back to the grindstone, plus there's an apartment to be cleaned and that rare commodity called sunshine outside, which might be worth taking advantage of before it disappears again.</td></tr>

They said it was not yet known how many people had been travelling in the cars destroyed in the carnage.<br /><br />The tunnel could remain closed until Monday as investigators examine the scene and engineers assess it for structural damage, police said.<br /><br />Explosions rocked the tunnel, motorists told of a huge wall of flames and temperatures soared above 1000 degrees. Police Assistant Commissioner Noel Ashby said some of the crash vehicles had turned into &quot;balls of molten metal&quot;. Investigators had still not identified the make of some of the cars.<br />&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br /><br />In particular, I am driven to comment on CityLink's response to the accident:<br /><br />&lt;blockquote&gt;<br />A motorist trapped in the tunnel, barrister Anthony Southall, QC, said the rescue effort was inadequate for those first frightening minutes when motorists were trying to walk out of the 3.4-kilometre tunnel unaided.<br /><br />&quot;There were no CityLink staff to direct us. In fact, there was a disabled lady in the car behind us and she needed some assistance.&quot;<br />&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br /><br />So what was CityLink doing?<br /><br />&lt;blockquote&gt;<br />CityLink spokeswoman Jean Ker Walsh said the initial accident had occurred very quickly, before a CityLink recovery vehicle could respond.<br /><br />&quot;We do know that immediately our lane closure system was activated. Regrettably, before an accident response team could get there, the incident occurred.&quot;<br />&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br /><br />&lt;blockquote&gt;<br />&quot;There are very strong practices to shut down a particular lane where necessary â€¦ it happened so instantaneously, emergency practices were just starting to occur when the second and third crashes occurred.&quot;<br />&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br /><br />Now, I don't know if road engineers use the same buzzwords, but in the field of software engineering we make a distinction between 'verification' and 'validation' as types of testing. &nbsp;Verification testing checks that some process occurred as specified. &nbsp;Seems the &quot;lane closure system&quot; passed this test. &nbsp;Validation checks whether the process had the desired effect. &nbsp;Obviously this is the more difficult type of testing. &nbsp;And we also see that the &quot;lane closure system&quot; did not have the desired effect. &nbsp;So perhaps it would be more helpful to say &quot;hmm, looks like we need better crash response procedures&quot; than to say &quot;well, our crash response procedures operated as designed, whoopeedoo!&quot;.<br /><br />&lt;blockquote&gt;<br />He urged motorists to put the tragedy into perspective. &quot;The tunnel's been around a long time,&quot; he said.<br />&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br /><br />This one really gets me. &nbsp;A long time? &nbsp;Puh-leeze... the tunnel was opened in December 2000 - it's just over 6 years old. &nbsp;CityLink have a contract with the government to operate the tunnel for 30 years [33 years and 6 months, &lt;a href='http://www.contracts.vic.gov.au/major/44/City_Link_Melbourne_City_Link_Concession_Deed.pdf'&gt;in fact&lt;/a&gt;]- so the tunnel has just passed one fifth of its expected operating time. &nbsp;Tunnels that have been around a long time are:<br />&lt;ul&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Kurikoyama tunnel, Japan (constructed 1880)&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Glenbrook railway tunnel, the Blue Mountains (constructed 1891-1892)&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Der Alte Elbtunnel, Hamburg, Germany (constructed 1907-1911).&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;/ul&gt;<br />I'd even give the honour to the &lt;a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Bernardino_(road_tunnel)'&gt;San Bernardino Tunnel&lt;/a&gt; in Switzerland, constructed 1967. &nbsp;But 6 years?<br /><br />At least they have some compassion:<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;<br />CityLink also announced today that tolls would be waived for affected motorists yesterday.<br />&lt;/blockquote&gt;</td></tr>

I did after all get a bit of a break. &nbsp;After opening all the Christmas mail on the 22nd, R and I caught a train to some of my relatives for 4 days of Christmas food, relaxing, a little laid-back sightseeing and more Christmas food; and following this we moved on to Berlin to visit J and U (and family), see some of the sights (R had never been) and to celebrate New Years Eve.<br /><br />We were greeted in Berlin with a layer of fresh snow, and some flakes still gently falling from the sky... perhaps not strictly speaking a &quot;White Christmas&quot;, but certainly better than nothing! &nbsp;After that first day though the snow melted away and the weather became a bit more mild (give or take some rain), which we were quite glad of during our sightseeing.<br /><br />Having weighed up the excitement of the Brandenburger Tor party against the prospect of being crammed into the &quot;Party Meile&quot; with one million other people, we decided to wander past the Party Meile early-ish in the evening to see how it was, and make a last-minute decision. &nbsp;At 7:30 there were no real crowds to speak of (at least, nothing unpleasant), three stages with live music and a festival atmosphere (complete with blinking party hats) in between, so we determined to come back later on (since the prospect of 5 hours outdoors didn't really appeal!) &nbsp;Although at 10:30 there were considerably more people - in fact the Brandenburger Tor gates were closed at various points because of overcrowding - the crowd at the SiegessÃ¤ule end was quite bearable, and so we got to see the famous fireworks after all. &nbsp;Well, the famous fireworks and lots and lots of private ones - most of them only confirming that the Australian ban on private fireworks is a very sensible idea... alcohol and gunpowder is not a good mixture! &nbsp;And since (in theory) fireworks weren't allowed inside the Party Meile zone, everyone was just setting off their fireworks around the perimeter before entering the party... lighting little whirlygigs and throwing them into the bushes at the side of the road, or setting off rockets at dangerous angles... the Aussie bushfire season is bad enough, thankyou very much! &nbsp;(According to official reports, the fire brigade was called out 1800 times that night.)<br /><br />Once again, photos &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ockle.org/photos&quot;&gt;where you've come to expect them&lt;/a&gt;.<br /><br />On Monday lectures start again, so I fear we may be in for another little stretch of &quot;nothing to report&quot;. &nbsp;But at least y'all know I'm still alive, and still (occasionally) capable of something exciting!</td></tr>

<td class="left data  not_null   ">Munich (et al)</td><td class="left data  not_null   ">Some of you may be wondering why I've disappeared for the last few weeks. &nbsp;Answer: I have been doing lots of running around (and some travelling). &nbsp;At the end of September, I visited family in Munich, managing at the same time to fit in some sightseeing (and of course Oktoberfest). &nbsp;We didn't get inside the tents at the big O, since it appears they fill rather early in the day, and once you leave they won't let you back in (if it's full). &nbsp;We also spent quite some time wandering around trying to find a seat in the beer gardens outside the tents, since the Rules say that they're not allowed to serve you a beer unless you have a seat. &nbsp;But eventually we found a seat and a beer (and a couple of Aussie soldiers on leave from Iraq). &nbsp;Was also rather impressed by the Olympic Park in Munich, possibly partly because my comparison is Homebush (100km out of town, and therefore deserted). &nbsp;Lots of greenery, nice lakes, stadiums (stadia?) etc that were in constant use, and lots and lots of people wandering around and making use of the public areas. &nbsp;Mind you, this is 15 minutes out of town on the U-bahn, instead of (see Sydney) over an hour, give or take a few train changes. &nbsp;(High-density living. Heh.)<br /><br />Upon returning to SaarbrÃ¼cken, I had a day to unpack, do laundry, clean up, etc, and then the following Monday I took receipt of R at the station, who has arrived after the usual 20+ hours on a plane plus train plus whatever to write a PhD at uni. &nbsp;Since then, we have: opened a bank account, signed a lease, registered at the town hall, enrolled at uni (a process taking several days and uncountably many secretaries, until we asked the International Office who told us what to write in which box and then took the form and enrolled us), bought kitchen appliances and a washing machine, and spent half a fortune at Ikea (the apartment is pretty large, but somewhat empty. &nbsp;Sans kitchen. &nbsp;Or ceiling lights.) &nbsp;Nice big strong men will come tomorrow and carry everything up the stairs. &nbsp;(We hope that's what they mean by &quot;delivery&quot;. &nbsp;I don't like the idea of us carrying it all upstairs ourselves.)<br /><br />This last weekend, because R had been noticing the distinct lack of a holiday between submitting her masters thesis (the previous Friday) and starting her PhD thesis (last Monday), we spent two nights in a little town called Bacharach in the middle Rhine valley, which has as its main attractive features that it is surrounded by vineyards and small wineries, and that the youth hostel is housed in the (somewhat rebuilt) ruins of the castle. &nbsp;Saturday and Sunday were then spent variously tasting wines, eating lots of very good food, visiting the Federweisser festival, and walking up and down and up and down the track to the youth hostel. On Sunday we took one of the cruise ships along the Rhine to St. Goar, where we then looked at the ruins of Burg Rheinfels, the largest castle on the Middle Rhine, as well as the Teddy Bear And Doll Museum. &nbsp;We then bought some bottles (of various things we had tasted or drunk with a meal throughout the weekend), and caught the train home.<br /><br />This coming Monday, lectures start at uni. &nbsp;I have also in between all this been chasing up some seminars (after learning my lesson last semester by missing out on one), and &nbsp;juggling a timetable together so I can pick my subjects next week. &nbsp;Once that is over, life might take on a slightly more normal pace again, and people who try to catch me might actually have a chance again...</td></tr>

<td class="left data  not_null   ">Holidays. Bike. Brussels. Amsterdam.</td><td class="left data  not_null   ">Yes, I'm still alive! &nbsp;Contrary to what a more-than-a-month-long silence on the blog front might suggest. &nbsp;I've just been busy, doing things that take lots of time but aren't interesting enough to blog about. &nbsp;Like exams. &nbsp;And work. &nbsp;And visiting friends in HÃ¶chstÃ¤dt, which, despite being interesting per se, does not make for much interesting blogging.<br /><br />But now I've finally done something worthy of a nice lengthy update. &nbsp;And to make sure I didn't leave anything out, I even took notes as I was doing it. &nbsp;On the back of a postcard-sized advertisement for the 22e Foire Internationale du Livre Ancien (or, if you prefer, since Brussels is officialy bilingual, the 22ste Internationale Beurs van het Oude Boeks). &nbsp;For the tourists, it's also written in English: the 22nd International Antiquarian Book Fair. &nbsp;This has its pros (since I speak neither French nor Dutch), and also its cons (since it doesn't leave much space for my scrawled notes). &nbsp;Nevertheless, here goes.<br /><br />First, a small disclaimer. &nbsp;&lt;a href='http://zapatopi.net/belgium/'&gt;Belgium doesn't exist&lt;/a&gt;. &nbsp;Therefore, the two days I think I spent in Brussels, I actually spent in a special pod beneath EuroDisney, and the memories I'm about to relate aren't actual real memories, but fake ones implanted by the New World Order to make me think I actually visited Belgium.<br /><br />The Netherlands do exist. &nbsp;Despite many offers of substances intended to produce the contrary effect, my memories of Amsterdam are real.<br /><br />I left Germany on the 7:30am commuter bus to Luxembourg on the 23rd. &nbsp;From there, a nice &quot;Belgian&quot; InterCity express train (fake, of course, as opposed to a real German InterCityExpress train) went to Brussels. &nbsp;Since I've done the SaarbrÃ¼cken-Luxembourg trip a few times now, and since it's almost entirely Autobahn, and since it was 7:30am, I slept through that bit. &nbsp;In Brussels I found my youth hostel, and then went for a bit of a wander, using &quot;looking for lunch&quot; as a suitable excuse to get nice and lost in the cobblestoned lanes and discover the city.<br /><br />One of my first observations in Brussels is that Belgium seems to be at the economical end of the kissing-as-greeting scale. &nbsp;In SaarbrÃ¼cken, Lorraine, and most of the Rheinland, the custom is two kisses - right cheek, then left cheek. &nbsp;Switzerland go the whole hog with three - right, left, right. &nbsp;In Brussels it's just the single peck. &nbsp;(This is more important than it seems. &nbsp;One kiss too many, and suddenly you're invading someone's personal space, and it gets awkward. &nbsp;One kiss too few, and you're being rude.)<br /><br />Having found a nice cafe that happily sold me a Sandwich with fromage and jambon (or kaas and ham, if you prefer), and a witbier (or a biere blanc, if you prefer), and seen the Grand Place (or the Grote Markt, if you prefer), I decided to find the Mont d'Art (Kunstberg), since near that was the Muziekinstrumentenmuseum (MusÃ©e des instruments de musique). &nbsp;(er, Musical Instrument Museum.) &nbsp;This was rather an amazing collection of all sorts of instruments, from traditional folk instruments to modern &quot;art music&quot; instruments to mechanical instruments to electronic instruments. &nbsp;I saw all manner of bagpipes, jew's harps, flutes, pianos, harpsichords, spinets, a glass harmonica, barrel organs, self-playing violins, pocket violins, Adolphe Sax's Saxophone (and various other things he invented that didn't catch on to the same extent), many &quot;serpents&quot;, a theremin, a Ondes Martenot, pianolas, and much more. &nbsp;Visitors were given headphones that played some music featuring the instrument you were currently looking at, wherever you were in the exhibition. &nbsp;Unfortunately the text was all in both Dutch and French but not English, so I had to struggle to either make out some of the French meaning, or convert Dutch sufficiently into German for it to make sense. &nbsp;After a while I gave up and just listened to the music.<br /><br />That evening I patronised a small jazz cafe that I had discovered on my earlier wandering-the-small-lanes-getting-lost adventure. &nbsp;This bar was sort of the same size and setup as Bennets Lane in Melbourne, for those of my loyal readers who are familiar with the establishment. &nbsp;There I drank some other Belgian beers (of course) while listening to a small swing quartet. &nbsp;'Twas muchly pleasant.<br /><br />Of course it goes without saying that in all this wandering your humble narrator never wandered past a waffle stand without stopping and eating one. &nbsp;Yum.<br /><br />The following day I decided to address a deficiency in my appreciation of the Beer-Waffles-Chocolate Belgian trio, and so I made my way at 10am to the Grote Markt (Grand Place) to visit the MusÃ©e du Cacao et du Chocolat (Museum van cacao en chocolade). &nbsp;Here we were introduced to the process by which the ingredients of chocolate are extracted from the cocoa bean, the history of the discovery of chocolate and its introduction to Europe, the chocolate traditions in Europe, as well as a live demonstration of how pralines are made, an exhibition of busts carved out of solid chocolate and clothes and hats made from chocolate sheets, and an extensive collection of crockery for the serving of chocolate - a &quot;chocolate service&quot; in the sense of &quot;tea service&quot;.<br /><br />Of course, a visit to the capital city of a monarchy necessitates a visit to the royal palace. &nbsp;As additional incentive, the guidebook I had dangled the carrot of an archaeological dig beneath the palace to expose the medieval castle and palace that had stood on the same place before the current palace. &nbsp;So I duly trudged up the hill to the hill and followed the red carpet (for the tourists) through the rooms on exhibition. &nbsp;After I had asked the waiter in the Parc de Bruxelles (Warandepark) &quot;ou est le Ancien Palais&quot; in my best broken French, I somehow managed to extract from his reply that he figured it was probably &quot;sur le Place Royale&quot;, but he didn't know exactly where. &nbsp;(Amazing how much context can help.) &nbsp;And he also suggested I should ask one of the palace guards. &nbsp;So I thanked him, and feeling rather proud of my foreign-language abilities, tried my best &quot;ou est&quot; on the palace guard, who managed to completely burst my bubble with a long stream of French that I couldn't decipher at all. &nbsp;Luckily he spoke almost perfect English and kindly pointed me in the right direction.<br /><br />Following my underground explorations, I also visited the toy museum, and the comic book museum. &nbsp;The toy museum, although being packed with kindergarten classes, made for a rather pleasant change in that visitors were allowed to touch and play with many of the exhibits! &nbsp;And the comic book museum was very impressive, exhibiting the history of Belgian comics, the production of comic books in general, the flourishing of Belgian comics under Nazi occupation (during which of course American comics were unavailable), and the evolution into both animated comics and the various modern styles.<br /><br />After dinner I caught the train out to the Atomium, since I had been advised by a friend that this was spectacular at night. &nbsp;This advice turned out to be rather misleading, since one can enter the Atomium and actually climb up into into the spheres, but only until 6pm; and although the newly-polished spheres reflected the setting sun rather beautifully, since the Atomium is more or less surrounded by parkland, once the sun has set there's not much for them to reflect. &nbsp;Nevertheless, a rather cool structure, with an interesting history - it was built for the International Exhibition in 1958, and intended to be dismantled afterwards, but the Belgian people liked it so much that they left it up, and in fact most recently restored (ie, polished) it. &nbsp;Interestingly, it's described everywhere as a &quot;single molecule of an iron crystal&quot;, which would send a certain high school chemistry teacher of mine into spasming fits, since iron does not form molecules! &nbsp;The term I think they're looking for is a &quot;unit cell&quot;... but I guess that doesn't sound as catchy in advertisements.<br /><br />The following morning, I checked out of my nice Hostelling International hostel and caught the InterCity train to Amsterdam. &nbsp;At 2pm I arrived at my not-Hostelling International hostel in Amsterdam - dingy, dirty, ten bunk beds to a room, one small toilet, one small shower. &nbsp;Crawling with British backpackers, since (as a nice English guy in the Brussels hostel explained to me) Monday was the last bank holiday in England until Christmas. &nbsp;What better to do on your long weekend than go to Amsterdam and get stoned? &nbsp;Well, I guess.<br /><br />Having arrived in Amsterdam, I noticed an advertisement at the hostel front desk for a free 3-hour walking tour, leaving the main station at 3pm. &nbsp;I promptly dumped my bags in the locker and joined this tour, which turned out to be the smartest thing I did all weekend - not only because it was a very nice, informative, entertaining tour (I can recommend it to anyone, and tentatively also their equivalents in Berlin and Munich), but also because I met a few other Aussie backpackers with whom I promptly exchanged phone numbers and promised to meet up again later that weekend.<br /><br />After the tour, I decided to pass up the 20â‚¬ one-beer-and-one-tequila-at-each-pub pub crawl, and just went for a wander around town. &nbsp;This, unfortunately, didn't leave me with a particularly positive impression of Amsterdam - in fact, the central district is not so much a city, more a theme park of sex and drugs for tourists. &nbsp;For good measure, I visited the &quot;erotic museum&quot;, which was rather a disappointment, but at least I tried somehow to engage with that side of Amsterdam. &nbsp;(On Monday morning I did consider that simply asking one of the &quot;women&quot; for her prices wouldn't really have done any harm, and might have satisfied some curiosity, but by that point it was too late.) &nbsp;Of course, photos of the women is strictly banned, and the women give you a very stern evil eye if you even walk past them carrying a camera in view. &nbsp;Once the camera is in the bag, however, their attitude changes completely. &nbsp;Rather amusing. &nbsp;The official Guide to Amsterdam has a section written by the police, warning (among the usual things like pickpockets and don't-fall-in-the-canals) that &quot;if you visit one of the women, we would like to remind you that they are not always women&quot;. &nbsp;Indeed. &nbsp;In fact I did see a few where I had my doubts... although according to our tour guide there is a &quot;blue light&quot; district alongside the red light district where women-that-are-not-women advertise themselves as such; I did not however encounter this district. &nbsp;One final remark on the women: every so often you see one of their little rooms empty, with the red and UV lights turned off, and a small sign on the glass or above the door saying &quot;kammer verhuur&quot; (&quot;room for let&quot;) which &nbsp;suggests to me that the people doing the best out of all this must be the owners of these rooms, who get to charge the women extraordinary amounts to rent the space, but don't have to put their bodies on the line in quite the same way to earn the money.<br /><br />On Saturday I decided I had seen about as much of that side of Amsterdam as I needed to, so I set out to find the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh museum. &nbsp;Having purchased tickets for these in advance at the tourist bureau, I waltzed right past the long ticket queues with a big grin on my face and was let in straight away. &nbsp;The Rijksmuseum unfortunately is currently being renovated, so only a small part of it was open to the public, but I'm not entirely certain I could have lasted three or four times as much museum as was still open, and I think that the exhibitions they had selected to show was somewhat distilled Rijksmuseum, the best without all the filler, so to speak. &nbsp;The Van Gogh Museum presented a huge collection of Van Gogh art, in chronological order, so one could see his initial progress (since he was self-taught), the effects of various influences on his art at different periods, and the progress of his mental illness until his suicide. &nbsp;Very interesting. &nbsp;The Van Gogh Museum also had a decent collection of lithographs and traditional Japanese art, both of which were large influences on Van Gogh.<br /><br />My wandering to the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh museum had taken me through some more pleasant parts of Amsterdam, so I was a little more positively disposed towards the town than I had been the previous night. &nbsp;I ate a rather late lunch in a park near the museums, and headed back to town to inspect some of the Uit Markt festival, the annual festival marking the official launching Amsterdam's cultural season. &nbsp;The festival of free concerts, exhibitions and theatre had been opened the previous night, and would conclude with the Koniglijk Concertgebouw Orkest performing Mahler's first Symphony (and thus the official opening of the cultural season). &nbsp;In a place near my hostel there was a stage featuring near-continuous jazz bands, and not too far from that was Het Bethanienklooster, with another stage (and one-hour queues), and a Sousterrain (cellar) containing a &quot;jazz lounge&quot;. &nbsp;In this context, &quot;jazz lounge&quot; consists of a bar, a dance floor, a DJ spinning groovy tunes, candelabras with candles, and bean bags.<br /><br />Having established that my new friends from Perth (with funny Perth accents) were still &quot;shagged out&quot; from the previous night's pub crawl and wanted to postpone seeing the Anne Frank Huis (and also any tentative jazz lounge-ing) until the following day, I thought I'd try my luck in the queue for the stage in the Bethanienklooster, where I got to chatting to a group of girls from Germany (Freiberg in fact, right near Crimmitschau where I was at the start of the month for a family gathering) who were enjoying their last real holidays before they had to get stuck into their Abitur. &nbsp;The band we ended up seeing after an hour of waiting was rather disappointing to say the least, and they turfed us out right afterwards so the people who had spent that hour waiting outside could get a turn, so the girls suggested they wanted to see something on the main stage at the Koniglijk Paleis (that is, the former town hall) and would I like to come. &nbsp;Well, I had no better plans, and considering I met them in the queue for a jazz band their tastes couldn't be too awful, so I figured why not. &nbsp;Being half an hour early, we got to see probably a hundred thousand Dutch people in the square enjoying Sing-A-Long Musicals, where a hyperactive Master of Ceremonies presented one Dutch musicals star after another singing the Big Hits of musicals - Memory from Cats, Tomorrow from Annie, half of The Wiz, etc - of course, all in Dutch. &nbsp;With surtitles so you could sing along. &nbsp;In Dutch. &nbsp;This little exercise left me with severe trouble keeping a straight face (particularly as the surtitles finished &quot;tomorrow's only a day away&quot; with &quot;ander daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaag&quot; - although I might have remembered one or two &quot;a&quot;s too few). &nbsp;But finally the musicals stars finished the grand finale from The Wiz and all traipsed offstage, and the wild, arm-waving, loud-singing Dutch people transformed into nice orderly queueing people waiting their turn to leave, and we managed to find some decent seats. &nbsp;The band we had come to see turned out to be the &lt;a href='http://www.blueman.com/'&gt;Blue Man Group&lt;/a&gt;, who were very entertaining. &nbsp;After all that entertainment I wandered back to my hostel. &nbsp;Thus the first day of Amsterdam.<br /><br />On the second day, I had planned a few small independent photography galleries, as well as the Pianola Museum, all of which had pressed brochures into my hand as I was wandering through the market that accompanied the UIT Markt. &nbsp;The two photography galleries were very cool; their somewhat postmodern, abstract focus was a nice balance to all the Rembrandt and Van Gogh I had seen the previous day. &nbsp;Also, finding the galleries took me through other nicer parts of Amsterdam, so that by now I wasn't feeling at all negative towards the place, rather just a little amused at all the prostitutes, and the &quot;coffeeshops&quot; (ahem) and the blokes on the street who would approach you asking &quot;cocaine? ecstasy?&quot;. &nbsp;So I had lunch and then a coffee in a nice cafe on a tree-lined canal among 17th century canal houses, and wandered a bit to find the Pianola Museum. &nbsp;Unfortunately this mission ended in disaster: although the pianola museum advertises its opening times as Zondag 2pm-5pm, at 2:30pm on Sunday the doors were most definitely closed, the lights were off, and both ringing the doorbell and phoning the number on the pamphlet achieved nothing. &nbsp;So, rather dispirited, I decided to head back to the Uit Markt and at least enjoy that. &nbsp;On the way to cheer myself up a little I bought some souvenir handmade Edam from a cheese shop guarded by a lithe black cat. &nbsp;Most food shops and cafes in Amsterdam have a cat: they're there to hunt the rats and mice that live in the damp cellars on account of the canals and the high water table (like most of the Netherlands, Amsterdam is below sea level).<br /><br />My total lack of Dutch notwithstanding, I was drawn to the Amsterdam Marionettentheater who were offering De Toverfluit (the Magic Flute), since Mozart's 250 years old and all (though you wouldn't really know it in Amsterdam, since Rembrandt is 400 years old this year). &nbsp;Performances in the Uit Markt festival seemed to be limited to strictly 25 minutes, so we just got the first 25 minutes of de Toverfluit (along with the suggestion to return later in the year when we could pay to see the whole thing); although this was story-wise a little odd, it was still a very entertaining performance. &nbsp;After that I got in touch with the Perth friends again, and we decided to head down to the Anne Frank Huis. &nbsp;(Late in the afternoon, since the pre-booked-to-avoid-queues tickets were only valid after 5pm.) &nbsp;Seeing the house in which the Franks and another family hid for years was rather a moving experience, and it was very well presented: with videos of interviews with Otto Frank (the only one who survived the war) and various of his staff, photos of the original furnishings (Otto requested that it remained unfurnished after his death), Anne Frank's original diaries (one diary and two school notebooks), et cetera. &nbsp;Quite a sobering experience. &nbsp;Of course, at the exit you could buy the Extra Special Edition Hardcover Only Available At The Anne Frank House Museum In Amsterdam Edition Of Anne Frank's Diary for 45â‚¬. &nbsp;I didn't.<br /><br />Following this, we went back to the stage in front of the Paleis to see the Concertgebouw Orchestra play Mahler, where I was tapped on the shoulder with a &quot;I &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; it was you!&quot; by none other than BA., who sends his greetings to everyone who is probably wondering why they haven't heard from him for ages. &nbsp;He and his boyfriend went back home to Utrecht right after the concert, since he was recovering from illness, so my Perth friends and I went to a pub for a few drinks and a chat to wind down. &nbsp;The following morning I checked out of the hotel and caught my InterCityExpressInternational back home. &nbsp;(Home, where I am quite relieved to pay less than half as much for groceries and bread and basic things than I was paying in Amsterdam. &nbsp;Eek!)<br /><br />In brief numbers:<br />Number of waffles eaten: uncountable<br />Number of comics seen: similarly uncountable<br />Number of languages inadequately spoken: 2<br />Number of chocolatiers spotted: approximately one per street corner<br />Number of Hercule Poirots spotted: none.<br />Number of musical instruments seen: several hundred<br />Number of countries visited: 3, not counting Germany (Luxembourg to Brussels via France. &nbsp;Not sure why.)<br />Number of museums: around ten (I'm not usually a museums kind of traveller, but they were too tempting!)<br /><br />Photos, of course, as always, are &lt;a href='http://www.ockle.org/photos'&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.<br /><br />Two other pieces of news bear mentioning, before I finish this up and go to bed.<br /><br />On the day before I left to go travelling, I bought myself a secondhand bike I had found through Findling (the local variety of Trading Post, if you like). &nbsp;Here it is, in all its glory:<br /><br />&lt;wpg2&gt;saarbrucken/karcherstrasse/Bild_17_.jpg&lt;/wpg2&gt;<br /><br />The other piece of news is that while I was away, my bed sprouted a new railing and a new ladder that is almost more stairs than ladder. &nbsp;Again, the illustration:<br /><br />&lt;wpg2&gt;saarbrucken/karcherstrasse/Bild_16_.jpg&lt;/wpg2&gt;<br /><br />Okay, I think that's all for now... that took rather longer to write than I had expected! &nbsp;High time for bed, methinks. &nbsp;G'nite all!</td></tr>

<td class="left data  not_null   ">Berlin, sniffle sniffle</td><td class="left data  not_null   ">So, the 25th was a public holiday. &nbsp;And since Thursday public holidays tend to mean that Friday's lectures are cancelled, and since I don't have any classes on Mondays anyway, that meant I got a super-duper long weekend. &nbsp;And since we're getting towards the business-end of semester now, I thought I'd take the opportunity of a bit of a trip, before I could no longer afford to take the time away from study, and while I had a 5-day weekend.<br /><br />The destination? Well, it was pretty obvious - there was one city which houses a rather large proportion of all the people I'd promised to visit, one city for which, I must admit, I have developed somewhat of an affection over my past few visits: Berlin. &nbsp;So, armed with my brand new (in fact, still &quot;provisional - present this receipt with some photo ID&quot;) BahnCard, I trundled down to the Bahn &quot;service centre&quot; at the station to put together some travel plans. &nbsp;Of course, these days that could all happen automatically over the Internet, but I wanted actual advice from a human, because I wanted to try something different - night trains! &nbsp;Yes sirree, the plan was to leave SaarbrÃ¼cken Thursday evening (leaving Thursday free to do all the uni work I would otherwise have done on the weekend), and arrive in Berlin Friday morning, then leave Berlin Monday evening and return to SaarbrÃ¼cken Tuesday morning, just in time for class. &nbsp;The nice service center person worked it all out for me, reserved seats on trains that required reservations, printed out the itinerary, and off I went.<br /><br />Several days later (on the Thursday evening, to be precise), I discovered a few things about night trains. &nbsp;The first is that you don't actually get all that much &lt;a href=&quot;http://dict.leo.org/ende?lp=ende&amp;lang=de&amp;searchLoc=0&amp;cmpType=relaxed&amp;sectHdr=on&amp;spellToler=on&amp;search=ruhe&amp;relink=on&quot;&gt;Ruhe&lt;/a&gt; in a Ruhesessel. &nbsp;(Meh. &nbsp;Next time I'll go with a bed.) &nbsp;The second is that Berlin is not really far enough away to make a night train worthwhile - a day train would take around 6 or 7 hours, and although the night train travels somewhat more slowly and even spends some time just standing still (to help you sleep, i believe), what with changing trains and etc there were still only 6 or 7 hours during which I could have slept (ignoring the discomfort of the Unruhesessel).<br /><br />Never mind, I'm young, the ol' body's been through worse, it'll recover. &nbsp;(It did.)<br /><br />Regarding catching up with people: I successfully made my way through the entire list. &nbsp;Stayed with J and U (such generous people!); had a fun dinner with J, U and K, and also a great night out with K and her somewhat-local friends (even if I piked on the dancing); saw the Da Vinci Code (Originalversion! such new-fangled amazement has yet to come to SaarbrÃ¼cken), and later had brunch, with C and his various local and somewhat-local friends; and had coffee and a good yarn with T. <br /><br />Regarding sightseeing: well, you know, there's no end of things to do in Berlin. &nbsp;Highlights include: the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmut_Newton&quot;&gt;Helmut Newton&lt;/a&gt; exhibition at the Museum for Photography (thanks I for the tip); finally making it &lt;i&gt;inside&lt;/i&gt; the Reichstag building (the rain drove the crowds away); and lots of just random wandering. &nbsp;Photos &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ockle.org/photos/2006-9631&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ockle.org/photos/2006-9630&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ockle.org/photos/2006-9826&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.<br /><br />The reason why I'm only blogging this more than a week later: I've had the sniffles the past week or so. &nbsp;Well, more than the sniffles - a decent, full-blown cold. &nbsp;This past weekend was spent almost entirely on trying to avoid any exertion, to try and recover as quickly as possible. &nbsp;I'm much better now, but not quite 100% yet. &nbsp;So that's my excuse. &nbsp;Now, I should head back to the aforementioned business end of semester. &nbsp;Tschau!</td></tr>

<td class="left data  not_null   ">Furniture!</td><td class="left data  not_null   ">Today was pay day. &nbsp;Coincidentally, but fortuitously; because today was visiting Ikea day (courtesy of A, who lived in this room before me, and his station wagon). &nbsp;I had budgeted &quot;around 250â‚¬&quot; and walked out with everything on my list and a receipt for 250,73â‚¬. &nbsp;So I was pretty chuffed (particularly since that estimate was based on about as much hard fact and prior experience as the cost of a software project at tender time. heh).<br /><br />Now my clothes have a more respectable home than a co-opted laundry rack, my books and papers no longer need to lie in piles on the scavenged corner table, I have a real desk, not just a trestle table, and a real bin rather than just a shopping bag. &nbsp;Photographic evidence follows. &nbsp;Apologies for the quality, but I figured that I could save myself some film costs by using the webcam for its intended purpose (instead of just a paperweight).<br /><br />&lt;wpg2&gt;saarbrucken/karcherstrasse/BTV+JPEG+001.jpg&lt;/wpg2&gt;<br />Ikea Where's Wally! Find: a bin, a desk, a small set of drawers, a rolling set of drawers + filing cabinet<br /><br />&lt;wpg2&gt;saarbrucken/karcherstrasse/BTV+JPEG+002.jpg&lt;/wpg2&gt;<br />The wardrobe. &nbsp;I picked a cloth/metal poles one instead of a wooden/Narnia one for two reasons: it was cheaper, and I thought it would be easier to transport (also for possible future moving of house). &nbsp;I didn't reckon with just how enormously heavy those metal poles are - this was the heaviest thing I bought today!<br /><br />&lt;wpg2&gt;saarbrucken/karcherstrasse/BTV+JPEG+004.jpg&lt;/wpg2&gt;<br />The bookshelf. &nbsp;I found a bookshelf I was quite happy with, and wrote it on my little Ikea notepad with my little Ikea pencil. &nbsp;Then around the corner I found an almost identical one, for 5â‚¬ cheaper, so I crossed off the first bookshelf and wrote this one instead. &nbsp;And around the next corner, again a very similar, yet cheaper one, so another edit to my notepad. &nbsp;And the next corner again. &nbsp;In the end, I found this for 13,50â‚¬. &nbsp;The red box is also from today's Ikea haul.<br /><br />&lt;wpg2&gt;saarbrucken/karcherstrasse/BTV+JPEG+005.jpg&lt;/wpg2&gt;<br />The mirror. &nbsp;I would have preferred a straight mirror, but that would have involved a large jump in price, and that wasn't going to happen. &nbsp;The mirror is in fact hanging straight; it just looks crooked due to a combination of optical illusion from the ladder and the fact that I can't hold the tiny webcam upright.<br /><br />I must confess that although I expected any Ikea to be rather like any other, I was rather astonished to find that (true to the McDonalds principle of &quot;never surprise your customer&quot;) this Ikea was practically _identical_ to the Melbourne store - right down to the food in the restaurant! &nbsp;I mean, obviously it's the same furniture, but the same menu?? &nbsp;(Well, if it works for McDonalds...)<br /><br />[For the benefit of T. and others who object to Ikea Swedish Minimalism, be assured that I did manage to find things that were not aesthetically offensive, even within my primary constraint of it-must-be-incredibly-cheap. Which nowhere does as well as Ikea.]<br /><br />To add to the pleasures of today, when I got home from Ikea, there was a DHL &quot;we tried delivering but you weren't home&quot; note in the mail for me... that'll be my 10â‚¬ Ebay ricecooker. &nbsp;Happily, the post office is open Saturday mornings too, so I can go pick it up tomorrow, just in time for me to cook something for lunch. &nbsp;Yum, rice.<br /><br />I am now rather exhausted from the effort of carrying all that furniture up two flights of stairs, and putting it all together. &nbsp;But I'm rather pleased that my room is now much neater than it was before. &nbsp;After all that excitement, it's probably well-deserved time for bed.</td></tr>

<td class="left data  not_null   ">Luxembourg, Roman Ruins, Uni, Apartment, Frisbee</td><td class="left data  not_null   ">On Saturday, because it was nice weather, I went to Luxembourg. &nbsp;I figured I could do my uni reading on the train. &nbsp;Went for a stroll through the city, saw the medieval fortifications (or the remnants thereof), the cathedrals, the town hall, and the Grand Duke's Palais, with the heavily armed guard (assault rifle with bayonet) in his Buckingham-Palace-Beefeater-esque box, and then spent an hour in the MusÃ©e d'Historie de la Ville de Luxembourg. &nbsp;Rather interesting; I could have spent 4 hours in there. &nbsp;But it was nice weather outside, and there was a flea market in the plaza outside the town hall, and they were closing. &nbsp;Much fun all round.<br /><br />Sunday, for a lark, I wandered down to the part of SaarbrÃ¼cken called RÃ¶merkastell (literally, &quot;Roman Castle&quot;) to have a look at the actual Roman Ruins after which the area is named. &nbsp;They're there, hiding behind the Grand Market Place (think Queen Vic market, but much more downmarket - or perhaps the Corio Saturday Market at the greyhound course, for anyone who is familiar with that), overgrown by grass: just a few mostly-prismic stones, revealing the shape of where a few houses (from probably a much bigger village) stood. &nbsp;This was the crossing of the Roman roads from Trier to Strasbourg and from Metz to Worms, so SaarbrÃ¼cken grew up here as a trading town. &nbsp;I also found the &quot;Mithras Grotto&quot;, where apparently in Christian Roman times the local barbarians/heathens secretly worshipped the Persian sun god Mithras. &nbsp;So that's my really-really-old-stuff fix for this week.<br /><br />Uni has started in earnest, and I'm starting to get past the stage of going-to-as-many-lectures-as-possible-in-order-to-select-subjects, and a subject selection is beginning to crystallise itself. &nbsp;There's still the &quot;initial meetings&quot; for two more seminars tomorrow and Thursday, of which I will probably take one this semester (whichever one I get a place in - places in seminars are restricted and can be hard to come by), and that completes my subject selection. &nbsp;I might post the exact subjects at the end of the week when it's finally decided... I'm not superstitious, I swear, but I'm not planning on jinxing my chances of getting into one of the seminars :-P<br /><br />This morning I got some rather big news... one of the shared apartments I had looked at in the last few weeks want me as their housemate. &nbsp;Yay :-D &nbsp;I can move out of this temporary motel-like (albeit architect-designed) guesthouse, and into something more permanent. &nbsp;That also means next weekend will be filled with moving house (and perhaps finding some furniture).<br /><br />And tonight I went down to frisbee training. &nbsp;There were about 20 of us, so we did some throwing for a warm up, a few drills, and then split into two teams for a short-ish game. &nbsp;'Twas fun; I'll be doing that again. &nbsp;But man, am I unfit! &nbsp;I guess that's hardly surprising, given the amount of physical exercise I've done in the past, oh, 16 months...<br /><br />The first roll (of three) of photos of (mainly) Luxembourg is at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ockle.org/photos&quot;&gt;http://www.ockle.org/photos&lt;/a&gt; (where else!). &nbsp;The reason there's one roll rather than three is that one of the three rolls is black and white, which means it needs to be sent away for processing, they can't do it in the lab, so that takes longer; and due to a misunderstanding only one of the two colour rolls was scanned onto CD. &nbsp;(I wondered why it was so cheap. &nbsp;I probably should have asked why I only got one CD, but silly trusting me just assumed they were saving the environment, since you don't really need two CDs for 2 x 60Mb of photos. &nbsp;Meh.) &nbsp;The other two rolls will be added as they are finished, probably in the next day or two.</td></tr>

<td class="left data  not_null   ">I've caught the interview meme</td><td class="left data  not_null   ">Questions by &lt;a href=http://juventus.livejournal.com&gt;juventus&lt;/a&gt;:<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;1. Why the Saarland? Have they got something we don't (like that Aussie-themed restaurant)?&lt;/b&gt;<br />Ah, well, hem. &nbsp;Many reasons. &nbsp;They include: &nbsp;I wanted to do postgrad and/or research. &nbsp;I wanted to travel. &nbsp;I wanted to live somewhere other than Melbourne. &nbsp;I speak German. &nbsp;Uni-des-Saarlandes have lots of research groups in areas that interest me, including the automated debugging work of the software engineering group, and the intelligent user interfaces group at DFKI (the German research centre for Artificial Intelligence). &nbsp;Uni-des-Saarlandes have the Max-Planck-Institut for Computer Science on campus, and they offer scholarships. &nbsp;(No scholarship means Martin can't afford to travel.) &nbsp;The Ormond Choir visited SaarbrÃ¼cken last tour, so I got to visit the university and talk to some people there. &nbsp;So, many reasons.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;2. What have you been up to, of late, in the Saarland (ran into any of the Total Vocal (grr) troupe? Visited said restaurant - what's the deep fried wombat nose like?)? When do you start studying?&lt;/b&gt;<br />Haven't found Total Vocal yet. &nbsp;Have walked past said restaurant, but I haven't dared enter. &nbsp;They use a curious variation of the Australian flag which replaces the Union Jack with the Boxing Kangaroo. &nbsp;They're using the typical German blindness for clashing colours to display an Australian republicanism. &nbsp;Heh.<br /><br />I start studying yesterday. &nbsp;Subject selections don't have to be finalised until next week or so, so at the moment &quot;studying&quot; consists of attending as many lectures as possible so I can decide which ones I want to do. &nbsp;Of course, not all subjects are equal: there's &quot;lectures&quot; and &quot;seminars&quot;, and the number of credit points varies depending on how advanced the subject is, and how much work it's supposed to require. &nbsp;And I need to put together a semester that has enough credit points, but also the right number of points in &quot;Basic&quot;, &quot;Advanced&quot;, &quot;Specialised&quot;, etc. &nbsp;So I'm not so much studying as getting my head around the German uni system. &nbsp;No lectures today, not because I have no lectures on Wednesday, but because the lecturer for the subject that could have started today had a paper due this week, so the subject starts next Wed. &nbsp;Heh.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;3. How's the apartment hunt going?&lt;/b&gt;<br />Hmm, 'tis interesting. &nbsp;I'm looking at heaps of apartments at the moment, mostly share apartments with randoms. &nbsp;This is because in Germany apartments aren't &quot;single&quot; or &quot;double&quot; or... (meaning one or two or... bedrooms, a kitchen, a lounge, perhaps a balcony), they're &quot;one room&quot; or &quot;two room&quot; or... (meaning literally one or two or ... rooms, containing perhaps two hotplates and a sink, and barely space for a bed and a desk). &nbsp;And I can't survive on just a hotplate for a kitchen :-P &nbsp;Besides, living in a share house with randoms might help me meet people here. &nbsp;And I'm already in a slightly adventurous mood, having travelled halfway across the world on my own, so I should probably take advantage of that before I lapse back into my normal shy-of-strangers self. &nbsp;(J, stop laughing. :-P)<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;4. What's in your CD player at the moment... bitch? :p (I'm in a mood.)&lt;/b&gt;<br />Nothing, bitch! &nbsp;In fact, my CDs stayed at home. &nbsp;Luggage weight restrictions and all that. &nbsp;And of course, in a couple of hours' (okay, weeks) continuous work, the music is all on my iPod anyway. &nbsp;Which is about half as big as a single CD. &nbsp;So if the question was really &quot;what's coming out your speakers at the moment&quot;, then the answer is &quot;Fats Waller: Handful of Keys&quot; (some random &quot;best-of&quot; album).<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;5. You are going to see Architecture in Helsinki when the reach your shores, aren't you? (Btw, that's less a question &amp; more of a statement.)&lt;/b&gt;<br />Statement, well, yes, indeedy. &nbsp;I want to go visit Luxembourg anyway :-)<br /><br /><br />For those confuzzled, here's the meme:<br />1. Leave me a comment saying, &quot;Interview me.&quot;<br />2. I will respond by asking you five questions of a somewhat questionable nature.<br />3. Update your LJ with the answers to the questions.<br />4. Include this explanation and an offer to interview someone else in the post.<br />5.

I hope it's the fact that I took them to El Cheapo (tm) Photo Developing, rather than that my camera has fscked three whole films... they seem uniformly out-of-focus, so here's hoping it's the developing. &nbsp;I might take my favourite photos to another place for reprinting, to see if they do it any better; if it's better I'll get a better place to scan them to a CD and put sharper photos online. &nbsp;Meanwhile, I've processed them a bit to make them bearable.<br /><br />As always: &lt;a href=http://www.ockle.org/photos&gt;http://www.ockle.org/photos&lt;/a&gt;.<br />More specifically: &lt;a href=http://www.ockle.org/photos/2006-531453&gt;Amess Street housewarming, and breakfast with Richard&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=http://www.ockle.org/photos/2006-531454&gt;the first film in SaarbrÃ¼cken and Sarreguemines&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href=http://www.ockle.org/photos/2006-531452&gt;the second film from Sarreguemines and SaarbrÃ¼cken&lt;/a&gt;.<br /><br />And of course you want to see some more mundane photos, of where I live and what I see around me, etc, so here they are (click for the album):<br /><br />&lt;wpg2&gt;saarbrucken/&lt;/wpg2&gt;<br /><br />In other news, I cooked chili con carne yesterday. &nbsp;From a packet, alas; although one day I will succumb to the temptation to just &quot;take a fresh and ripe tomato&quot;... and of course I sang while I was cooking :-P<br /><br />Also bought a German cookbook today, because I didn't take any of my Australian ones with me (weight considerations!!), and I'd rather not rely on stir-frys, spaghetti bolognese, and packet meals. &nbsp;And so that I have something to read other than my Lonely Planet, I invested in &quot;Sakrileg&quot; by Dan Brown (er, that was called &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; before it got translated.) &nbsp;I also ventured into the AuslÃ¤nderbehÃ¶rde and marvelled at the queues, I think I'll try going there again early in the morning, with my book, and a lot more patience.<br /><br />I have also begun another scarf, although I suspect I will finish it just in time for the weather to warm up and me not to need it any more. &nbsp;But oh well. &nbsp;Photo:<br /><br />&lt;wpg2&gt;craft/BTV+JPEG+002.jpg&lt;/wpg2&gt;<br /><br />I'd better get back to actually knitting that.</td></tr>

<td class="left data  not_null   ">Un pan aux chocolat, s'il vous plait...</td><td class="left data  not_null   ">Caught the tram to France today.<br /><br />(I like the sound of that.)<br /><br />(I also didn't pay a cent because Sarreguemine is inside the SaarVerkehrsVerbund region covered by my semester student ticket. &nbsp;Woohoo!)<br /><br />You know you're in France because the tram announcement is no longer &quot;NÃ¤chste halt: Kleinblittersdorf&quot; and instead it's &quot;Prochain arret: Sarreguemine&quot;; because the signs are in French; because people are speaking French instead of German (including the people on the tram...); and because there's dogshit all over the footpaths.<br /><br />Also, rather unexpectedly, because every second store is a &quot;chocolatier&quot; or a &quot;boulangier&quot;. &nbsp;One was the size of a small supermarket. &nbsp;(Well, a big 7-11, perhaps.) &nbsp;Yum. &nbsp;Unfortunately my dream of popping over the border for un cafÃ© et un croissant under an umbrella in the sun was not realised, since I couldn't find an establishment that seemed to offer this service. &nbsp;Instead I bought a pan aux chocolat in a paper bag and ate it on the grass opposite the Palais du Justice.<br /><br />While I was waiting for the tram in SaarbrÃ¼cken (and snapping photos to while the time), a young lady (well, my age) approached me and asked why I was taking photos in this part of town, it was ugly and boring, and I should go to X and Y because the people were much more interesting there. &nbsp;And had I ever held eine &quot;ausstellung&quot; of my photos (the English word slips my mind here), because one of her friends does that every so often and it's so cool! &nbsp;To which I answered, um, er. &nbsp;In fact I think she probably has a point, my photos of today are probably going to be dreadfully boring, due to the lack of people. &nbsp;But then, I'm not completely comfortable taking photos of complete strangers. &nbsp;They might not like it. &nbsp;And at the end of the day, I'm left with photos of people I don't know. &nbsp;I guess I could at least have taken a photo of this young lady, as a reminder of the (somewhat bizarre) experience of meeting someone at a tram stop who took an immediate interest in my work, just cos I was pointing my camera at the surrounding buildings...<br /><br />Speaking of photos, I took three rolls in to be developed today. &nbsp;Unfortunately I picked a relatively cheap place, which means they don't do it on-site, so I have to wait 3 or 4 business days. &nbsp;Poo. &nbsp;Well, patience is a virtue, they say...<br /><br />(who are &quot;they&quot;??)<br /><br />Oh, by the way: a bottom update. &nbsp;I think all the bum posters are advertising underpants. &nbsp;That might explain the lack of anything else on the posters but a bum and a witty slogan. &nbsp;(Saw another one today that said &quot;why not walk past again?&quot;)<br /><br />Today was the first day of the SaarbrÃ¼cken Spring Festival. &nbsp;Which means, lots of stalls and street entertainers in town. &nbsp;Instead of cooking dinner, I bought a Schwenker (mmm, barbecued pork slab) from a hut that was basically a small barbecue and a huge serving-lots-of-customers-sized schwenker in the very center. &nbsp;Now all my clothes smell of wood smoke. &nbsp;T'was very yum, but very fatty.<br /><br />This morning I completed all my paperwork for IMPRS. &nbsp;:-D<br /><br />Hmm, I'm getting tired. &nbsp;Perhaps it's time to see what dubbed entertainment the idiot box is bringing me tonight. &nbsp;(Watched Star Wars last night. &nbsp;That was rather entertaining. &nbsp;&quot;Dass hier ist Err-zwo-dii-zwo, und ich bin Zee-drei-pe-oh!&quot; &nbsp;&quot;Obi-van! &nbsp;Den Name hab' ich schon lange nicht mer gehÃ¶rt...&quot; &nbsp;The &quot;Rasender Falken&quot;... &quot;Die Macht sei bei dir, Luke!&quot; &nbsp;Oh dear! &nbsp;Once again, profound apologies on the lack of photos...</td></tr>

<td class="left data  not_null   ">More SaarbrÃ¼cken</td><td class="left data  not_null   ">I have decided it's not worth re-writing last night's effort into narrative form. &nbsp;I think it makes enough sense as it stands. &nbsp;And I started taking photos with my real camera rather than the webcam, so rather than duplicating the effort I think I'm just going to make you all wait until I get the film developed.<br /><br />Also Irina (my buddy) asks me to add that while she did mis-type both of her phone numbers to me, she subsequently stayed at the station waiting for every train to arrive, and asked the public if they had seen me, and even put an announcement over the PA speaker saying &quot;if MS is around could you please come and find me&quot;. &nbsp;Of which I am quite in awe. &nbsp;(Particularly since I seem to be taking up her time between exams...)<br /><br />I have made a few further observations about the town. &nbsp;Again since I have no storytelling talent, I shall just list them.<br /><br />Most stores accept only cash. &nbsp;This is remarkably inconvenient for someone used to paying for things with EFTPOS or credit. &nbsp;Alternatively, one transfers money via your bank. &nbsp;(Which is of course not helpful while I only have an Australian bank account. &nbsp;This situation will of course improve shortly.)<br /><br />I have a german mobile phone now. &nbsp;It should be &quot;activated&quot; by tomorrow. &nbsp;Ask me for the number if you want it. &nbsp;(I'm not putting it on a public website!!)<br /><br />My apartment is not only named &quot;Kandinsky&quot;, it's themed. &nbsp;All the art on the walls (that I was too tired to notice yesterday!) are Kandinsky prints. &nbsp;Heh.<br /><br />Re bums on billboards, there's quite a few billboards around town featuring a scantily-clad shapely bottom, and the caption &quot;nothing to see here, move along&quot;. &nbsp;And nothing else. &nbsp;Not entirely sure what that's advertising...<br /><br />I found the German world-cup strip in a store. &nbsp;And the French one. &nbsp;Both are very cool designs. &nbsp;Why is it that the Australian one is so drearily boring? &nbsp;(Well, Germany and France wear Adidas, while Australia wears Nike... although I'm sure that has absolutely nothing to do with it. &nbsp;Hm.)<br /><br />Law &amp; Order, CSI, Monk, etc, dubbed into German is considerably less successful than MythBusters dubbed into German. &nbsp;At least it's properly dubbed, not the &quot;commentary&quot; sort of thing we saw in Poland last year. &nbsp;Ick.<br /><br />Razor cartridges are remarkably expensive. &nbsp;Perhaps I'll grow a beard. &nbsp;:-P</td></tr>

<td class="left data  not_null   ">Hello Martin's new home</td><td class="left data  not_null   ">Just some random disconnected thoughts, because I'm still jetlagged.<br /><br />Being on a University LAN is blindingly fast Internet compared to Australian commercial ADSL. &nbsp;Weee!<br /><br />The guesthouse apartments are quite nice, they consist of a large room with double bed and huge desk and lots of space and TV and sideboard and etc, plus a bathroom, plus a corridor joining the two (and containing more wardrobe space and a mirror). &nbsp;They're named after people. &nbsp;Mine is named after &lt;a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wassily_Kandinsky&gt;Wassily Kandinsky&lt;/a&gt;. &nbsp;It also has a little sign on the door saying &quot;Herr Strauss&quot;. &nbsp;Cool.<br /><br />I needn't have worried about missing the people-diversity of Melbourne. &nbsp;SaarbrÃ¼cken is a university town, and is also near the border with France and Luxembourg and near Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands (and, well, for any Australian definition of &quot;near&quot;, it's near Spain and Poland too, but anyway...). &nbsp;And so there's a wide variety of people, skin colours, languages, clothing walking down the street. &nbsp;It's very cool.<br /><br />It's cold. &nbsp;The snow has all thawed away, and the lake that they were apparently ice skating on a few weeks ago is all liquid again now, but the thermometer definitely is pointing to brrrr. &nbsp;The rain, interrupted by periods of beautiful sunshine, is remarkably Melbourne.<br /><br />For a town that according to that infallible source of facts, Wikipedia, has less population than Geelong, the CBD-y shopping-y bit of town is huge, has enormous variety and choice, and is humming with people on a random Monday afternoon. &nbsp;All of which makes Martin happy. &nbsp;I found an asian grocer (admittedly, only one, but I was afraid there might be zero), and they stock woks for â‚¬6.99. &nbsp;I shall purchase one once I have found slightly more permanent accomodation. &nbsp;Also, it is nice to see book- and music-stores with an actual variety of stock, not just heaps and heaps of copies of the latest chart toppers. &nbsp;Also nice to see is H &amp; M, for all my european-fashion, australian-budget clothing needs (how nice to have those two concepts coincide!), and Saturn, for discount electrical: particularly useful at that horrid moment when I realise that my ethernet cables are not in the suitcase, but in one of the boxes I mailed last week. &nbsp;Not sure which. &nbsp;(â‚¬4.99 later, problem solved.)<br /><br />I have leet guess-the-correct-german-phone-number skillz. &nbsp;The email my &quot;buddy&quot; sent me containing her mobile and home phone numbers, to call her on when I arrived at the station, contained 2 (that's 100%) incorrect numbers. &nbsp;Luckily the error was &quot;too many digits&quot; rather than &quot;wrong digits&quot;, so after one &quot;er, no, don't know what you're talking about, bugger off&quot; (sorry mate, just a wrong number, happens to the best of us!) and lots of &quot;the number you have dialled is not valid&quot;, I finally found my buddy. &nbsp;Big grin.<br /><br />A few things I need to get used to in Germany: &nbsp;Cars drive on the other side of the road. &nbsp;Before you say &quot;well, duh&quot;, yes, I have worked this out at some point during my last few visits to Europe. &nbsp;But you still get caught out occasionally, with a &quot;hey, nobody's driving that car!&quot; moment, or finding yourself waiting on the wrong side of the road for the bus. &nbsp; Oops. &nbsp; Also, Tobacco is everywhere. &nbsp;Not just that everybody is smoking, but that there's vending machines on street corners, and ads on billboards. &nbsp;You don't appreciate how nice Australia's ban on _advertising_ is until you don't have it any more! &nbsp;Speaking of advertising, the other thing that I need to get used to is the enormous amount of boobs and bum that Europeans consider appropriate for public billboards. &nbsp;Um er.<br /><br />For those of you whom I have previously told about my two official &quot;babysitters&quot;, I have learnt today that the correct (if not necessarily official) term is &quot;mummy&quot;. &nbsp;That's what the older students call them. &nbsp;Speaking of older students, the lingua franca seems to be English. &nbsp;(In fact, the lingua franca around the MPI seems to be English, although at the Mensa [food hall] for lunch, I overheard English, German, French, Japanese, etc...) &nbsp;And of the 6 or 7 students I met today, 2 were male. &nbsp;(not counting me). &nbsp;Which is about the opposite of what I would have expected in a computer science faculty. &nbsp;Good to see that somewhere in the world, things are different.<br /><br />The noticeboards in the faculty and the institute are groaning with the weight of &quot;apartment for rent&quot;, &quot;flatmate wanted&quot;, &quot;bike for sale&quot;, etc ads. &nbsp;I should rip off some phone numbers and hit the tellyfones, once I'm a bit more settled.<br /><br />And now I'm going to munch on my dinner - a &quot;DÃ¶ner kebap&quot; from town. &nbsp;Because I haven't picked up my &quot;starter kit&quot; yet, so cooking would be somewhat difficult. &nbsp;Thinking of cooking, maybe I won't wait until I've found a more permanent place before picking up one of those woks...<br /><br />I promise to edit some of these thoughts into something slightly more readable tomorrow. &nbsp;I should also add some photos of my surroundings, since I bought a slightly capable webcam for precisely that purpose. &nbsp;Possibly that might produce something worth emailing to all those people who told me they refuse to read blogs so could I email them anything I write here. &nbsp;Hmmm.</td></tr>

Managing director Andrew Cameron said: &quot;It seems Sydney is ready to consider corporate styling, and we hope to take the concept to the rest of Australia&quot;.<br /><br />$Ms$ Moss believes money should be no object when it comes to dressing well.<br /><br />&quot;This is not only about wearing suits, just a good quality shirt with a nice print and smart slacks is often enough as long as everything co-ordinates.&quot;<br /><br />She added that wearing natural fibres was also important. &quot;Polyester doesn't wear well, and gets sweaty and smelly,&quot; she said.<br /><br />Her top tip for those seeking a fresh look is to photograph a variety of nice combinations from your wardrobe to use as a reference when dressing in the morning.<br /><br />She also recommends looking through magazines to get a feel for what suits you. &quot;This is about thinking about what suits you instead of following trends,&quot; she said.<br /><br />And if you must wear jeans and thongs in to work, feet must be in a good condition. &quot;That means no yellow toe nails,&quot; she said.<br /><br />$Ms$ Moss said retail ranked as the second most unfashionable profession with some of the salesmen in the industry displaying &quot;quite shocking&quot; dress sense.<br />&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br /><br />Frankly, I'm shocked. &nbsp;(although possibly not surprised.) &nbsp;I mean, really... reference photos of successful combinations from your wardrobe!?</td></tr>

They should be completed. =)<br />&lt;ul&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;South Morang extension&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Craigieburne extension - The track is there, as is Craigieburne station, it just needs a couple of stations (and trains of course)&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Langwarrin station on the Stony Point line.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Cranbourne East station after Cranbourne.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;On this subject, short extensions to the next suburb on some of the outer arms of the star would also be good:<br />&lt;ul&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Link the Upfield line up to the Broadmeadows line extension - the track is there, it just needs trains to run on it.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;The Yarra Valley Tourist Railway could be used to extend the Lilydale line out to Healesville.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;And use the Mornington Peninsular railway to extend the Stony Point line out to Mornington&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;/ul&gt;<br />Basically, the idea with these is that they get:<br />&lt;ul&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Government funding to restore their infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Validators / vendys for metcards.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Their share of the profits from the sale of these.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;And timetabled platform space at Baxter/Frankston and Lilydale.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;/ul&gt;<br />In return they would run somewhere in the reigon of 4-6 trains a day over their tracks as commuter trains ticketed with Metcards. They'd also have the option of running their usual steam / whatever services whenever they want with their own tickets.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;There probably should be a tram link to the airport too =&gt; tourists seeing the classic icon of Melbourne, it's trams, immediately upon entering the city. (It'd have to be light rail to keep transit times down, maybe along the highway, and joining up with, or extending, the #59 on the Tullamarine Freeway.)&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;The Geelong line: (does this mean that Geelong is now part of Melbourne???) I think it should be extended from your plan to go out to the new Marshall station. (Via breakwater for the Geelong Cup =) ) Yay, one ticket to go from home in Melbourne to home in Geelong. Sadly it'll cost about the same as it does now with V-Line. V-Line should run the Werribee-Marshall line with their new fast trains. (Basically, the same service they run now, but terminating at Marshall more often, accepting suburban passengers within the MET, and accepting Metcards for the journey, possibly with ticket machines / validators on the trains).&lt;/li&gt;<br /><br />For the long term:<br />&lt;li&gt;maybe a &quot;zone 3&quot; linkup between the Frankstone line through Cranbourne and merging with the line to Pakenham at Officer, and a similar thing for the Belgrave line, through Belgrave south, and looping back to the city on the Pakenham line at Berwick.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Maybe also resurrect the South Gippsland Railway as an extension of the Cragieburne line.&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;/ol&gt;<br /><br />Hmm, maybe I'm getting a little obsessive about this =)<br /><br />Maybe I'm also putting too much thought into it =)<br /><br />So, why not continue?<br /><br />I have updated your big map with what I've described above. (points 1,&lt;br /&gt;2, 4 in dark red, and 5 in orange) It's 2.6 MB, so if you want it, email / talk to me. &nbsp;I've also attached an updated version of your train diagram with the new extensions and stations filled in<br /><br />Have fun!<br /><br />--<br /><br />Julian Calaby<br /><br />&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br /><br />Here's the pics to go with it... unfortunately the Healesville rail extension is off the edges of the Melways map that I produced:<br /><br />&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ockle.org/blog/wp-content/melbourne-diagram3.0.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.ockle.org/blog/wp-content/melbourne-diagram3.0.jpg&quot; width=80% border=0/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;<br /><br />&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ockle.org/blog/wp-content/melbourne3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.ockle.org/blog/wp-content/melbourne3.jpg&quot; width=80% border=0/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</td></tr>

<td class="left data  not_null   ">Public Transport</td><td class="left data  not_null   ">PT seems to have become an issue in the papers again recently, with reports coming out that Melbourne's PT system isn't working. (Gee, who'da thunk it...)<br /><br />I'm not an expert on these things, but having visited a few cities with what I would consider working public transport systems, I have to say there's a bit of a gaping hole in Melbourne's train network... let's take a couple of examples:<br /><br />Berlin: <br /><br />&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ockle.org/blog/wp-content/berlin.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.ockle.org/blog/wp-content/berlin.png&quot; width=80% border=0 /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;<br /><br />London:<br />&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ockle.org/blog/wp-content/london.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.ockle.org/blog/wp-content/london.png&quot; width=80% border=0 /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;<br /><br />Melbourne:<br />&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ockle.org/blog/wp-content/melbourne-diagram1.0.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.ockle.org/blog/wp-content/melbourne-diagram1.0.jpg&quot; width=80% border=0 /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;<br /><br />What's the difference? &nbsp;London and Berlin both have LOOPS. &nbsp;That's right, the working train networks aren't just a star, in fact the different lines cross each other all over the place. &nbsp;(gad, even &lt;em&gt;Sydney&lt;/em&gt; has that!) &nbsp;Whereas in Melbourne, let's say you wanted to get from Camberwell to Brighton Beach... let's say we'll rule out throwing yourself on the mercy of the disaster that is Melbourne buses, then you have to go ALL THE WAY into Richmond station and then out again. &nbsp;A trip that should be 10 minutes or so in a car probably gets to about 45 minutes or more on trains. &nbsp;Or what about getting from the airport to Glen Iris? &nbsp;Forget it.<br /><br />So, just because I should be studying and procrastination is FUN!, let's add a couple of meaningful loops to Melbourne's train network: one where there used to be one years and years ago, (the &quot;inner loop&quot;), and one roughly where zone 1 becomes zone 2. For fun, why not throw in a rail line to the airport, because that's overdue if anything ever is. &nbsp;Oh, and let's electrify the track to Geelong, because damn, why not. &nbsp;So what do we get?<br /><br />&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ockle.org/blog/wp-content/melbourne2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.ockle.org/blog/wp-content/melbourne2.jpg&quot; width=80% border=0 /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;<br />(red lines represent existing rail lines, green represent the ones I would build.)<br /><br />&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ockle.org/blog/wp-content/misc/melbourne-diagram2.0.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.ockle.org/blog/wp-content/melbourne-diagram2.0.jpg&quot; width=80% border=0 /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;<br /><br />Amount of common sense used: no more than most people should be equipped with; Likelihood of something like this actually happening: erm, maybe once Dubya gets his degree in rocket science from Cambridge... Isn't this fun!<br /><br />(In fact, there was talk of a train tunnel connecting Melbourne Uni to Southbank... how this benefits anyone other than Melbourne Uni students who want to go to Southbank beats me...)</td></tr>

<td class="left data  not_null   ">Why oh why did I drink Smoko Goon?</td><td class="left data  not_null   ">The little men pounding on the inside of my head this morning are making their objections heard very loudly. &nbsp;But it was Valedictory Dinner and my last (ever!) Ormond smoko! &nbsp;What else could I do? &nbsp;The pain will pass, but the memory of the fun will remain. &nbsp;(yes, I have memories, how much did you think I drank? :-P)<br /><br />Some people have asked me for a copy of my valedictory speech. &nbsp;To save lots of tedious emailing and printing and etc, here it is:<br /><br />&lt;blockquote&gt;<br />Last November, for the first time in three years, I packed all my stuff at Ormond into boxes and prepared to leave this College over the holidays. Apart from a brief period in the summer of 2001/02 and a few Choir tours, I had lived at Ormond continuously for four years; and to be perfectly honest, it was time for a change. &nbsp;I had been offered a scholarship to spend the summer working at the University of New South Wales on a research project, and I thought it would do me good to get out of Melbourne, and Ormond, at least for those ten weeks.<br /><br />Now, those of you who know me well will know that I don't like being woken by a beeping alarm; my alarm wakes me gently by turning on the radio. &nbsp;Those of you who know me very well know that the radio is invariably tuned to ABC Classic FM. &nbsp;One morning in January, on the dot of 7:30am the radio clicked on, and what else should drift into my sleep but the opening phrase of Elgar's Pomp and Circumstance March number 1. &nbsp;I've never been as aware of how much I love and will miss Ormond as I was at that moment.<br /><br />I've spent five years at this college - that's my entire undergraduate degree. &nbsp;I've been involved with a number of Ormond plays; I've sung in the choir and toured Europe three times; I've been the head of a subcommittee; I've been a member of the MCR; I've helped at and been to many smokos; and I've only ever missed one formal dinner. &nbsp;However, the list of things I haven't done is equally impressive. &nbsp;I've never been on a sporting team; I haven't been on the O-week subcommittee, or to ski week. I've never even been to the pub on Monday nights.<br /><br />And this is the essence of what makes College life wonderful. &nbsp;There are so many opportunities to try something new; and there are so many amazing people who provide your closest friends.<br /><br />But while I was in Sydney, I was also staying in a university college. &nbsp;These things are as true about Warrane College as they are about Ormond. &nbsp;Why then should I miss Ormond?<br /><br />For me, what makes Ormond more special than any other college is the diversity we have here. &nbsp;We have so many events, activities, and subcommittees on offer that you can't possibly do everything; and that's as it should be. &nbsp;I would much rather have the choice of events at the cost of missing out on something, than have no choice at all, just so that I could participate in everything on offer.<br /><br />Just as important is the diversity of Ormond residents. There are people in hall today of all ages, academic disciplines, backgrounds, and tastes. &nbsp;At Ormond we learn to live together in our diverse community; and to hold PSEs alongside smokos, music soirees alongside the sporting championships, and the play alongside the ball.<br /><br />But let's not forget that even Ormond can learn from other colleges. &nbsp;While I was in Sydney, I admired the way Warrane was very clear about its role as an academic community. &nbsp;Warrane held one evening lecture or seminar each week - even over the summer holidays! - and a group of senior students was organising an annual conference - in 2005 it was to be on Australian music, and they invited prominent Australian composers, performers and musicologists to lecture and conduct seminars with the residents, and with other members of the community.<br /><br />Ormond is three times as large as Warrane College and we have vastly more diversity. &nbsp;One of the most wonderful things about Ormond is being able to live with people doing such a diversity of academic work: being able to talk to Rob Richardson about dissecting rats over lunch, and Richard Jackson about Proust and Rachmaninov over dinner, and Richard Lee about the GST at supper. &nbsp;We should remember that our studies and learning aren't confined to our classes and tutes; because after all, we can get the &quot;learning&quot; kind of academia at uni; what we can get nowhere but Ormond is the &quot;social&quot; kind of academia.<br /><br />One thing that I've come to realise in my time at Ormond is that all these things we enjoy aren't natural; this state of affairs isn't the normal way for things to be. &nbsp;Left to itself, a college won't turn into Ormond; in fact it will become the opposite: a homogeneous society with only one kind of social activity and one small set of talents. &nbsp;We need to realise that Ormond is the way I have described it because many people, ourselves included, work hard to keep it that way.<br /><br />I would like to use this opportunity, as so many before me have done, to throw down a challenge to the Ormond community. &nbsp;I would like to see all of Ormond - from the Master right down to the shyest fresher - discussing their visions, dreams, or ideas of what Ormond should be. &nbsp;And I don't mean wishy-washy, vague values such as &quot;community&quot;; I mean concrete questions that people can act on, such as &quot;how can the MCR make returning to college attractive for senior students?&quot; or &quot;how can we re-organise the calendar so it's easy to find a good date for a PSE or the Bursary booze cruise or Car Rally?&quot;<br /><br />I've been given the opportunity to speak tonight, and I've told you part of what I enjoy at Ormond, and what I would like to see at Ormond, but that's just one person's opinion - if we want to keep Ormond as diverse as it has been in my time here, we all need to talk about our ideas of what Ormond should be. &nbsp;But also, we need to value each other's opinions; and significantly, we need to value parts of Ormond that, like Monday night Naughton's for me, we haven't experienced - not just because one day we might, but because everybody else here has equally as much right to make Ormond theirs as I do.<br /><br />And most of all, we should take the time to appreciate all those people at Ormond who have improved the lives of those around them, not through anything they have done or achieved, but simply through the conversations they have had at lunch, or the seminar they gave that was irrelevant for your course but nevertheless interesting, or the chocolates they bought you during SWOT vac. &nbsp;Because at the end of the day, it's not the trophies we've won or the money we've raised for charity that makes this a great community. &nbsp;Of all the opportunities that Ormond offers us, the greatest one is the opportunity to meet other Ormondians. &nbsp;And this is what I will take away from Ormond, and treasure for the rest of my life, above smokos, balls, PSEs, choir rehearsals, tutes, AGMs, and student service: I have been privileged to call all of you friends.<br />&lt;/blockquote&gt;</td></tr>

Whoops... so now I have a new shirt. (Strictly speaking, it's a &quot;spencer&quot; shirt, and what Anton's call a &quot;pirate&quot; shirt is similar, but with less frills and more elaborate buttons.)

Upper Class is about being born into privilege, inheriting money, connections, perhaps a job from parents rather than earning it themselves. Ich. Martin has not much respect for this kind of &quot;success&quot;. Lower Class is about whingeing about the Upper Class (that is, people who have X but don't deserve X or haven't earnt X), without doing anything about it yourself. Martin has not much respect for this kind of &quot;misfortune&quot;.<br /><br />(*) probably a better term than &quot;lady&quot;.<br /><br />[so far, so good.]<br /><br />Being a &quot;gentlemwoan&quot; is about style. It's about dressing up to go to the theatre. It's about standing up and offering an elderly passenger your seat on the tram. It's about holding the door for the person behind you.<br /><br />[too easy!]<br /><br />It's about looking into someone's eyes and smiling when you shake their hand, and saying &quot;pleased to meet you&quot;. It's about being genuine and honest when talking to people, and not just following the Toorak Socialite pattern of conversation: &quot;Well, I haven't seen you since we were at Timbertop together. How are you doing with yourself? That's wonderful! Well, I have to run back to Trinity to organise the ball. We must meet again!&quot;. (yeah, right.)<br /><br />It's about respect for yourself; respect for others; respect for traditions (even when you're trashing them). It's about dressing up by wearing a top hat or furs, not by flashing a boob on national television. It's about splurging occasionally on a designer skirt or shoes. It's about looking good not out of vanity, but out of respect for yourself. It's about caring for yourself with good food and exercise, not with a fashionable gym membership, a tanning salong and a Brazilian wax. (ouch.)<br /><br />It's about going to an expensive restaurant every so often. It's about drinking expensive drinks in moderation, rather than the cheapest beer they've got, by the keg. (Although a $350 drink with gold leaf garnish is pushing even my budget.)<br /><br />It's about knowing what's proper. It's about wearing a hat and gloves when you go out sometimes. It's about having a sense of humour; and being able to laugh at yourself. It's about being generous; realising that building an enormous Victorian mansion with a ballroom effectively obliges you to host balls.<br /><br />It's about realising that a &quot;ball&quot; is not a university event at a nightclub with free Kahlua, but an occasion to dress up, meet people, hold conversations, and dance. That means there needs to be enough quiet and not-too-dark space to actually hold conversations. There needs to be enough light to admire what people are wearing.<br /><br />It's about taking compliments humbly, but not self-deprecatingly. It's about giving more compliments than you receive, and giving them honestly. It's about noticing a gentleman's new hair, tie, or shoes, and commenting on it. (Everybody loves being complimented on their appearance. Even if they say they don't.)<br /><br />It's about the combination of style and substance. All style and no substance makes Frank Abnagale Jr - any bank in the country will cash a piece of paper you've embossed with the words &quot;this is a cheque... no really!&quot;, but you'll still feel unsatisfied.

<td class="left data  not_null   ">well, gee, would you look at the date...</td><td class="left data  not_null   ">it must be time for me to post again.<br /><br />Went to Hamilton with the choir. &nbsp;Came back again. &nbsp;Exhausted. &nbsp;Nothing to see here, move along.<br /><br />I'm so over ANZAC day. &nbsp;Have been ever since school. &nbsp;No disrespect to anyone who actually fought in the wars we're celebrating (are any of them still alive?) but can somebody explain to me why we're celebrating war at all?<br /><br />I've got a midsemester test tomorrow. &nbsp;I should be studying. &nbsp;Instead, I'm blogging. &nbsp; &nbsp;Woohoo.<br /><br />(This post is a bit incoherent and random, isn't it? &nbsp;I'll try to get better as I go along.)<br /><br />I was asked something recently that got me thinking. &nbsp;What is it that I admire so about the 19th century European gentlemen you read about in Sherlock Holmes or Jules Verne? Let's see...<br /><br />Being a 19th century gentleman(*) in 21st century Australia is not about Class. &nbsp;Upper Class is about being born into privilege, inheriting money, connections, perhaps a job from parents rather than earning it themselves. &nbsp;Ich. &nbsp;Martin has not much respect for this kind of &quot;success&quot;. &nbsp;Lower Class is about whingeing about the Upper Class (that is, people who have X but don't deserve X or haven't earnt X), without doing anything about it yourself. &nbsp;Martin has not much respect for this kind of &quot;misfortune&quot;.<br /><br />(*) or lady. &nbsp;Gender is irrelevant. &nbsp;But since I'm thinking mainly about myself, and since I'm male, we'll talk about gentlemen.<br /><br />Being a &quot;gentleman&quot; is about style. &nbsp;It's about dressing up to go to the theatre. &nbsp;It's about standing up and offering an elderly passenger your seat on the tram. &nbsp;It's about holding the door for the person behind you.<br /><br />It's about looking into someone's eyes and smiling when you shake their hand, and saying &quot;pleased to meet you&quot;. &nbsp;It's about being genuine and honest when talking to people, and not just following the Toorak Socialite pattern of conversation: &quot;Well, I haven't seen you since we were at Timbertop together. &nbsp;How are you doing with yourself? &nbsp;That's wonderful! &nbsp;Well, I have to run back to Trinity to organise the ball. &nbsp;We must meet again!&quot;. &nbsp;(yeah, right.)<br /><br />It's about respect for yourself; respect for others; respect for traditions (even when you're trashing them). &nbsp;It's about dressing up by wearing a top hat or furs, not by flashing a boob on national television. &nbsp;It's about splurging occasionally on an Italian silk shirt. &nbsp;It's about looking good not out of vanity, but out of respect for yourself. &nbsp;It's about caring for yourself with good food and exercise, not with a fashionable gym membership, a tanning salong and a Brazilian wax. &nbsp;(ouch.)<br /><br />It's about going to an expensive restaurant every so often. &nbsp;It's about drinking expensive drinks in moderation, rather than the cheapest beer they've got, by the keg. &nbsp;(Although a $350 drink with gold leaf garnish is pushing even my budget.)<br /><br />It's about knowing what's proper. &nbsp;It's about wearing a hat and gloves when you go out sometimes. &nbsp;It's about having a sense of humour; and being able to laugh at yourself. &nbsp;It's about being generous; realising that building an enormous Victorian mansion with a ballroom effectively obliges you to host balls.<br /><br />It's about realising that a &quot;ball&quot; is not a university event at a nightclub with free Kahlua, but an occasion to dress up, meet people, hold conversations, and dance. &nbsp;That means there needs to be enough quiet and not-too-dark space to actually hold conversations. &nbsp;There needs to be enough light to admire what people are wearing.<br /><br />It's about taking compliments humbly, but not self-deprecatingly. &nbsp;It's about giving more compliments than you receive, and giving them honestly. &nbsp;It's about noticing a lady's new hair, top, or shoes, and commenting on it. &nbsp;(Everybody loves being complimented on their appearance. &nbsp;Even if they say they don't.)<br /><br />It's about the combination of style and substance. &nbsp;All style and no substance makes Frank Abnagale Jr - any bank in the country will cash a piece of paper you've embossed with the words &quot;this is a cheque... no really!&quot;, but you'll still feel unsatisfied. &nbsp;All substance and no style and you might as well blend in with the rest of the homogeneous crowds in Melbourne - walk around for a day in torn jeans, rubber thongs and a rugby jumper with the collar turned up to see what i mean. &nbsp;But the combination of both is what makes a 21st century gentleman. &nbsp;It's what we mean by &quot;gallantry&quot;; &quot;chivalry&quot;; &quot;gentlemanly conduct&quot;. &nbsp;That's what I'm talking about.</td></tr>

I have arrived in Sydney, and I said to myself that I would post something when I arrived in Sydney; but so far I've been here 3 days with scarce time to collect my thoughts, let alone put (metaphorical) pen to (metaphorical) paper. (or &quot;fingers to keys&quot;. Yes, let's stick with &quot;fingers to keys&quot;.)<br /><br />The first thing to notice here in Sydney is...<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Temperature&lt;/b&gt;<br />It's hot. Damn hot. It was around 40 degrees on Sunday when I arrived, with a kind of burning heat hanging in the air. I don't usually mind the heat, but this was &lt;em&gt;painfully&lt;/em&gt; hot. Yesterday was kind of pleasantly hot, and today is sweat-pouring-out-of-veins hot. I guess the fact that the college computer room isn't air-conditioned probably helps. Well, anyway, I arrived on Sunday and caught the 400 bus to the UNSW campus in Kensington, and walked the ~100m to arrive at...<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Warrane College&lt;/b&gt;<br />This is where I'm staying for my 10 weeks in Sydney. $200 per week, 3 meals per day, seems like a good deal. On the whole, it's cool. (except, it's hot. but whatever.) Not all that similar to Ormond, really... no locks on doors (lockable cupboards and drawers instead; tiny rooms, but much more common-room style facilities; no phones in rooms; much worse food (well, I have to say it); and internet access in rooms is limited to UNSW websites. Ouch. On the other hand...<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Internet&lt;/b&gt;<br />UNSW seems very mercenary about their Internet access. They have campus-wide wireless access, but you have to let them install their own VPN client on your notebook, and then you pay for every bit of data you transfer. The CSE department grant you IP quota, which gets eaten away steadily by your web browsing, email checking, etc. Even Warrane only give you 150Mb quota per month, after which you get cut off (I believe). Seems the grand Internet is much more of an optional, user-pays, luxury here than it is at Melbourne. Too bad most papers and stuff that needs to be read is online...<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Location&lt;/b&gt;<br />Well, it's not Lygon St, Carlton. Kensington and Kingston (which are the suburbs near here) are predominantly Indonesian/Malaysian; this is also good food (I went out for dinner on Sun, yum yum) but it's all a bit more dingy and a bit less urban than Carlton. On the other side of Uni there is Randwick with the h-u-u-u-u-u-g-e racecourse, a nice view of the city, and a decent shopping strip. I think that's the destination of choice for things like Coles, clothes, etc. Of course, a 10 or so minute bus trip gets you to the city, or Bondi Junction where there's a humungous (no really) shopping center. And from Bondi Junction, 5 minutes on the bus gets you to the beach. (well, maybe a bit longer, I didn't actually time them). And I tell you what, when the temperature hits 40 on a Sunday, the beach is packed.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Facilities&lt;/b&gt;<br />Well, the Faculty have said that they will provide us with swipe-cards to get into CSE labs, but that seems to be &quot;in the works&quot; and will take a little longer. NICTA have their own lab in the EE building, which looks like the lap of luxury - modern coffee machine, lots of big cubicles, new computers, a projector and screen, couches, a view of Sydney, etc. That's where we'll be mostly working, I think. NICTA are working on getting us swipe-card access to the NICTA lab, and that should be ready some time this afternoon. We hope. There's a wireless network at CSE which is quite convenient for my little notebook; I haven't checked to see whether there's anything in the NICTA lab.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Research&lt;/b&gt;<br />Here's the fun bit. I'm one of 3 students working with researchers in the KRR (that's Knowledge Representation and Reasoning) group in the AI department (that's Artificial Intelligence) in the school of CSE (Computer Science and Engineering). Got all that? Anyway, my project is to do with 'empathic computing', also known as 'affective computing' (which kind of sounds like 'affected computing' which means something completely different :-P) Background can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;http://affect.media.mit.edu/&quot;&gt;http://affect.media.mit.edu/&lt;/a&gt; which is the website of the MIT group who came up with the idea and are working on it. &nbsp;The plan is to come up with an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_%28computer_science%29&quot;&gt;ontology&lt;/a&gt; of physiological, visual and audio signals and emotional states, for possible future use in an emotion-sensitive computing application. If we have time we can then do some fun programming by creating an example application to use our ontology. Fun fun research! Also, next week and the week after we'll all go to Canberra for the Logic Summer School at ANU. That will be fun too. :-)<br /><br />Well, that's all I can think of for now, I'll check back in when I think of something else, or if anything interesting happens. (like, anything else interesting.)</td></tr>

KRR-9 is this:<br /><br />&lt;blockquote&gt;<br />As computing devices become more common, affordable and miniaturised, one can imagine a future in which such devices are capable of adapting and responding to user needs by being aware of the user's mental and emotional state. For example, if the computing device determines that the user is stressed, it adapts its behaviour to present information in a more terse manner whereas if it senses that the user is relaxed, the information can be presented in a more verbose way. These notions have led to the idea of empathic computing and affective computing.<br /><br />This project aims to investigate the types of concepts that need to be represented in order to model users' mental and emotional states. In particular, to consider what sorts of information can be gathered about the user (e.g., biofeedback monitoring, gesture recognition, facial recognition, etc.), how this can be represented, and how such representation might be used for the purpose of reasoning to infer information about the users' mental and emotional state. The objectives of this project are to:<br />&lt;ul&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Develop an empathic ontology (catalogue of concepts) using the web ontology language (http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-features/) OWL&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;li&gt;Determine how information represented using this ontology can be used to make inferences about the user's state&lt;/li&gt;<br />&lt;/ul&gt;<br />&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br /><br />ooh aah.<br /><br />In other news, today (well, today in the US of A, yesterday in Australia or something) is election day. &nbsp;A plea to my American friends... please please please with a cherry on top don't give us Bush for another four years!!</td></tr>

Well, Martin got busy and other things took over time, but I guess there's always a point in the evening where I can't be bothered doing any more work, and I could have written something in that time. But I didn't.<br /><br />What I did do is vote below the line in the senate. Of 65 candidates, Family First got votes number 62 and 63 (64 and 65 were reserved for One Nation). Didn't stop a Victorian FF senator getting the balance of power... what with 38 of the 76 Senate seats in Liberal hands, I guess Labour won't bother trying to pass any legislation in the next 3 years; and any Coalition legislation that comes with a &quot;Family Impact Statement&quot; will pass. Woohoo. Welcome to no-gay-rights, no-industrial-relations, xenophobic, censored, Australia.<br /><br />It seems a bit odd that a party called &quot;Family First&quot; advocates taking many of the key attributes of what they themselves see as the prime function of a family, vis bringing up kids, away from parents and into central govt control. For example, the whole ISP-level Internet censorship bullshit. I find it difficult at the best of times to swallow the &quot;We don't trust families to do what's right by their kids, so Government needs to step in and censor TV/Radio/Newspapers/Books/Internet/etc&quot;. It's worse when it's coming from a so-called pro-&quot;family values&quot; party (that goes for you too, Johnny). If you're really pro-&quot;family values&quot;, let's see more freedom for families to exercise their values and less regulation of what a family is and what it is allowed to do...<br /><br />A truly pro-&quot;family values&quot; stance would be to widen the range of options available to families. Allow gay marriage. Allow gay adoption, and access to IVF for same-sex couples. Grant same-sex-couple families the same rights as &quot;traditional&quot; (yuck) families. Encourage Australian-made children's TV, children's movies, children's books. Values can't be enforced, they have to be taught by example... and if we prevent children from ever making their own value judgements by always legislating to keep contentious issues out of the control of families, they'll grow up to be value-less people who need new-age &quot;christians&quot; to tell them what is right and wrong.<br /><br />I lament the impending death of morality discussions around the family dinner table. I lament the impending death of choice. I lament the fact that we are determined to produce a generation of uneducated (don't get me started on Nelson reforms), valueless xenophobes who need a good traditional conservative cricket-loving government like John Howard's to tell them what to do.<br /><br />Bah.</td></tr>
