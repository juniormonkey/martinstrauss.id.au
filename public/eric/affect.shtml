        <h2>Affective modelling in ERIC</h2>
        <p><strong>Affect Generation</strong> in ERIC occurs by first using a 
        set of cause-effect and belief relations to assign appraisals of 
        emotion-eliciting conditions (EECs) to facts in the world model based 
        on a set of goals and desires.  These appraisals are used by ALMA [<a 
            href='http://scholar.google.de/scholar?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&cluster=18183707157603362131'>Gebhard, 
            2005</a>] to generate an affective state (medium-term moods and 
        emotion events) according to the OCC cognitive model of emotions [<a
            href='http://www.google.com/scholar?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&client=safari&cluster=9350847958247222945'>Ortony et al, 
            1988</a>].  The generated affective state is then expressed by the 
        ERIC agent in his lexical selection, his gestures, and his facial 
        expressions; in addition, expression through his prosody is planned as 
        future work.</p>

        <h3>Appraisal of Emotion-eliciting Conditions</h3>
        <p>ALMA generates emotions using appraisals of seven emotion-eliciting 
        conditions: desirability, probability, realization and liking of 
        events, praiseworthiness and agency of actions, and appealingness of 
        objects.  These appraisals are made by comparing events, actions and 
        objects observed in the world against the agent's goals and 
        desires.</p>

        <p>If an event or action we desire occurs, this is appraised 
        positively; conversely, if an event or action we desire to avoid 
        occurs, this is appraised negatively.  Also, when an object we like 
        occurs in the discourse state (because it has just been mentioned in 
        the commentary), it is appraised positively; conversely, when an object 
        we dislike occurs in the discourse state, it is appraised negatively.  
        Appraisals of agency and realisation are made by observing the world 
        model.  Agency is appraised by identifying the agent of each action.  
        An event is appraised as realised if it has occurred in the world.  As 
        well as these basic appraisals, cause-effect relations allow us to 
        appraise events, actions and objects that are not specified in the 
        goals and desires. 
        
        <h3>Goals and Desires</h3>
        <p>To be able to compare events, actions and objects against goals and 
        desires, we need to specify events or actions we would like to see 
        occur (<em>goals</em>), events or actions we would not like to see 
        occur (<em>antigoals</em>), and objects we like or dislike.  
        Additionally, the agent maintains a set of beliefs about other actors'
        goals and desires, to enable him to judge the desirability of events 
        for the players in the scenario.</p>

        <p>The goals and desires are specified in a separate configuration file 
        to the main affect module, since they are dependent on the world model 
        and thus domain-specific.  Thus they can easily be altered to match 
        both a change in domain and a change in intended audience.</p>

        <h3>Cause-Effect Relations</h3>
        <p>Some of these appraisals are simply specified in the goals: for         
        example, liking and appealingness of objects.  Similarly, agency of 
        actions can be easily observed from the world model when the actions 
        are observed;  and realisation of events is similarly observed from the 
        world model.  However, in order to reason about events and actions
        that are not directly part of our goals, but still somehow related to 
        (or influencing) our goals, we need to codify the relations between 
        non-goal events, actions and objects and goals.  This is done by means 
        of the four relations: <em>leadsto</em>, <em>hinders</em>, 
        <em>supports</em> and <em>contradicts</em>.  The first two relations 
        model causality:

        <ul>
            <li><em>a</em> leadsto <em>b</em> if <em>a</em> increases the 
            likelihood of <em>b</em>, and</li>
            <li><em>a</em> hinders <em>b</em> if <em>a</em> decreases the 
            likelihood of <em>b</em>.</li>
        </ul>

        The second two relations model logical deduction or belief:
        <ul>
            <li><em>a</em> supports <em>b</em> if knowledge of <em>a</em> supports 
            belief in <em>b</em>, and</li>
            <li><em>a</em> contradicts <em>b</em> if knowledge of <em>a</em> 
            contradicts belief in <em>b</em>.</li>
        </ul>

        These relations are used to propagate appraisals of desirability, 
        praiseworthiness, and likelihood in the following way:

        <ul>
            <li> <em>a</em> leadsto <em>b</em>
            <ul>
                <li> <em>a</em> inherits some of <em>b</em>'s 
                desirability/praiseworthiness, and</li>
                <li> the likelihood of <em>b</em> is increased when <em>a</em> 
                occurs.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li> <em>a</em> hinders <em>b</em>
            <ul>
                <li> <em>a</em> inherits the opposite of <em>b</em>'s 
                desirability/praiseworthiness, and</li>
                <li> the likelihood of <em>b</em> is decreased when <em>a</em> 
                occurs.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li> <em>a</em> supports <em>b</em>
            <ul>
                <li> if <em>a</em> is observed (realization = true), then 
                <em>b</em> also has realization = true</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li> <em>a</em> hinders <em>b</em>
            <ul>
                <li> if <em>a</em> is observed (realization = true), then 
                <em>b</em> has realization = false</li>
            </ul></li>
        </ul>

        In these calculations, desirability and praiseworthiness are 
        interchangeable: they appraise almost the same quality, except that 
        desirability describes an event and praiseworthiness describes an 
        action.  Thus, if <em>a</em> is an event and <em>b</em> is an action, 
        <em>a</em>'s praiseworthiness will increase proportional to 
        <em>b</em>'s desirablity.</p>

        <p>The generated emotions are depicted in the character's facial 
        expression, and he may also comment on them in his discourse.  His mood 
        state is reflected in the gestures that accompany his speech and 
        waiting, and also influences his lexical selection during natural 
        language generation.</p>
