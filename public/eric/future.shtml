        <h2>ERIC: an embodied real-time intelligent commentary agent</h2>
        <p><strong>Future work</strong> includes reflecting the character's 
        affect in the prosody of his speech, generating gestures based on the 
        semantic content of his speech, and generalising the agent's production 
        of coherent discourse.</p>
        <p>The prosody module will take the character's current affective 
        state, and produce prosodic specifications to depict the affective 
        state.  The prosody will be generated according to established 
        relationships between affective state and speech prosody in humans.</p>
        <p>The gesture module currently generates some gestures in response to 
        events it receives from the knowledge reasoning module.  It would be 
        desirable to replace this link with a link to semantic information 
        coming from the NLG module, thus making the gesture generation module 
        domain-independent.</p>
        <p>Discourse coherence is currently maintained by the fusion module, 
        integrated with priority-based and random selection of a single 
        utterance from all the candidates.  We wish to have the discourse 
        coherence selection separate from the final selection, such that an 
        intermediate module between the NLG and fusion modules forms a 
        shortlist of templates according to the discourse theory rules, and the 
        fusion module only chooses from this shortlist.  Then the role of 
        maintaining discourse coherence could be filled by several 
        interchangeable modules modelling different theories of discourse 
        coherence.</p>
