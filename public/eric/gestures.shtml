        <h2>Gestures and Facial Expressions in ERIC</h2>
        <p><strong>Gesture and Facial Expression Generation</strong> is covered 
        by two modules in ERIC.  The facial expression module is quite simple: 
        the Charamel character provides a selection of facial "morphs" that can 
        be expressed, and the facial expression module merely maintains a 
        dictionary mapping each emotional component of an affective state to a 
        Charamel morph.</p>

        <p>Gesture generation in the RaceReporter takes two forms: on the one 
        hand, various events that are recognised by the knowledge reasoning 
        module trigger specific individual gestures in the character.  On the 
        other hand, the character has two set of "background" or base gestures, 
        one for idle times and one for while he is speaking.  The gesture 
        generation module maps each mood component of an affective state onto a 
        set each of idle and speaking gestures, so that (for example) the agent 
        moves around much more when he is exuberant or excited than when he is 
        bored or sad.</p>

        <p>In addition, the gesture generation module generates commands to 
        change the camera angle according to the intensity of the character's 
        mood: the more intense the mood, the closer the shot.</p>
