        <h2>ERIC: an embodied real-time intelligent commentary agent</h2>
        <p><strong>ERIC</strong> is an intelligent embodied agent framework 
        that can provide running commentary on a continuous event in real-time.
        It is currently implemented to commentate a horse race provided by the 
        RaceSim system used in 
        <a href='http://hmi.ewi.utwente.nl/gala/'>GALA '07</a>; with minimal
        modification the system is configurable to commentate on any live 
        continuous event (for example, sports matches, news as-it-happens, 
        computer games, etc).</p>

        <p>ERIC is able to generate real-time commentary for a dynamic 
        environment, responding to ongoing events and unforseen facts.  It has 
        a sophisticated affect model, with a simulated personality, moods and 
        emotion events.  The agent performs template-based natural language 
        generation, using topic and context information for macro-level 
        discourse structure, and affective state information for lexical 
        selection.  It has a highly modular architecture based on parallel 
        rule-based reasoning engines, implemented in Java and <a 
            href='http://herzberg.ca.sandia.gov/jess/'>Jess</a>, a rule-based 
        system itself implemented in Java.  The agent also follows a strict 
        separation of general and domain-specific knowledge, for easy re-use 
        across event domains.  In addition, The agent's personality, and the 
        goals and desires used to generate emotions, are configurable.</p>

        <p>ERIC brings together a number of different components for knowledge 
        representation and reasoning, natural language
        generation, affective appraisal, gesture and facial expression 
        generation, and output selection.  The output is sent to a <a 
            href='http://www.charamel.de'>Charamel</a> embodied character, 
        depicted by the CharaVirld player.  The overall system contains 300 
        deduction rules as well as 70 NLG templates, and at any time each 
        component handles several hundred facts.</p>
        
        <p>For more information on the architecture and individual components, 
        see below.</p>

        <p>ERIC is developed by <a href='http://www.martinstrauss.id.au'>Martin 
            Strauss</a> as part of his Masters thesis at the <a 
            href='http://www.dfki.de/iui/'>Intelligent User Interfaces 
            group</a> (<a href='http://www.dfki.de/~wahlster/'>Prof.  
            Wahlster</a>) at the <a href='http://www.dfki.de'>German Research 
            Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)</a>, under the
