        <h2>HorseRaceReporter: an embodied agent providing real-time 
        commentary</h2>
        <p><strong>HorseRaceReporter</strong> is an intelligent embodied agent 
        that can provide running commentary on a continuous event in real-time.
        It is currently implemented to commentate a horse race provided by the 
        RaceSim system used in 
        <a href='http://hmi.ewi.utwente.nl/gala/'>GALA '07</a>; with minimal
        modification the system is configurable to commentate on any live 
        continuous event (for example, sports matches, news as-it-happens, 
        computer games, etc).</p>

        <p>The HorseRaceReporter is able to generate real-time commentary for a 
        dynamic environment, responding to ongoing events and unforseen facts.  
        It has a sophisticated affect model, with a simulated personality, 
        moods and emotion events.  The agent performs template-based natural 
        language generation, using topic and context information for 
        macro-level discourse structure, and affective state information for 
        lexical selection.  It has a highly modular architecture based on 
        parallel rule-based reasoning engines, implemented in Java and <a 
            href='http://herzberg.ca.sandia.gov/jess/'>JESS</a>, a rule-based 
        system itself implemented in Java.  The agent also follows a strict 
        separation of general and domain-specific knowledge, for easy re-use 
        across event domains.</p>

        <p>The HorseRaceReporter system brings together a number of different 
        components for knowledge representation and reasoning, natural language
        generation, affective appraisal, gesture and facial expression 
        generation, and output selection.  The output is sent to a <a 
            href='http://www.charamel.de'>Charamel</a> embodied character, 
        depicted by the CharaVirld player.  The overall system contains 300 
        deduction rules as well as 70 NLG templates, and at any time each 
        component handles several hundred facts.</p>
        
        <p>For more information on the architecture and individual components, 
        see below.</p>
        <!--#include file="menu.html" -->

        <p>The HorseRaceReporter system is developed by <a 
            href='http://www.martinstrauss.id.au'>Martin Strauss</a>as part of 
        his Masters thesis at the <a href='http://www.dfki.de/iui/'>Intelligent 
            User Interfaces group</a> (<a 
            href='http://www.dfki.de/~wahlster/'>Prof.  Wahlster</a>) at the <a 
            href='http://www.dfki.de'>German Research Center for Artificial 
            Intelligence (DFKI)</a>, under the supervision of <a 
            href='http://www.dfki.de/~kipp/'>Michael Kipp</a> and <a 
            href='http://www.dfki.de/~gebhard/'>Patrick Gebhard</a>.</p>

        <p>Many thanks to <a href='http://www.charamel.de/'>Charamel</a> for 
        providing the 'Paul' character, and <a 
            href='http://www.nuance.com/'>Nuance</a> for providing the 'Tom' 
        voice.</p>
