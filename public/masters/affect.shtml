        <h2>RaceReporter: an embodied agent providing real-time commentary</h2>
        <p><strong>Affect Generation</strong> in the HorseRaceReporter is done 
        according to a layered cognitive model of affect called ALMA [<a 
            href='http://scholar.google.de/scholar?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&cluster=18183707157603362131'>Gebhard, 
            2005</a>].  ALMA models three layers of affect: personality (global 
        and long-term), mood (global and medium-term), and emotion (local and 
        short-term).  In the ALMA model, an agent appraises perceived events, 
        actions and objects using the following categories:</p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>Events<ul>
                <li>GoodEvent</li>
                <li>BadEvent</li>
                <li>GoodEventForGoodOther</li>
                <li>GoodEventForBadOther</li>
                <li>BadEventForGoodOther</li>
                <li>BadEventForBadOther</li>
                <li>GoodLikelyFutureEvent</li>
                <li>GoodUnlikelyFutureEvent</li>
                <li>BadLikelyFutureEvent</li>
                <li>BadUnlikelyFutureEvent</li>
                <li>EventConfirmed</li>
                <li>EventDisconfirmed</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Actions<ul>
                <li>GoodActSelf</li>
                <li>BadActSelf</li>
                <li>GoodActOther</li>
                <li>BadActOther</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Objects<ul>
                <li>NiceThing</li>
                <li>NastyThing</li>
            </ul></li>
        </ul></p>

        <p>These tags are assigned to events, actions and objects by the affect 
        generation module based on the agent's pre-specified goals and desires, 
        and reasoning rules that specify which events or actions lead to other 
        future events and actions, and knowledge of which events or actions 
        increases or decreases the likelihood of other (unknown) events or 
        actions.  The goals, desires and cause-and-effect knowledge is 
        necessarily domain-specific; the reasoning however is not.</p>

        <p>The tags generated by the affect generation module are passed to 
        ALMA, which maintains an affective state for the agent and adjusts the 
        state according to the incoming tags, as suggested by the OCC cognitive 
        model of affect [<a 
            href='http://scholar.google.de/scholar?hl=en&lr=&cluster=9350847958247222945'>Ortony 
            et al, 1988</a>].  This affective state is then passed to the 
        affect generation module's observers.</p>

        <p>The generated emotions are depicted in the character's facial 
        expression, and he may also comment on them in his discourse.  His mood 
        state is reflected in the gestures that accompany his speech and 
        waiting, and also influences his lexical selection during natural 
        language generation.</p>
