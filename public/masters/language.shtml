        <h2>RaceReporter: an embodied agent providing real-time commentary</h2>
        <p><strong>Natural Language Generation</strong> in the 
        HorseRaceReporter is performed by a template-based system similar to 
        D2S [<a 
            href='http://scholar.google.de/scholar?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&cluster=12804268520876462187'>Theune
            et al, 2001</a>]  and YAG [<a 
            href='http://scholar.google.de/scholar?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&cluster=4745656158252165375'>Channarukul, 
            1999</a>], using Jess rules to represent the templates.  These Jess 
        rules are generated by Java code (since they share significant 
        structure); in future it is planned to extract the specification from 
        which the templates are generated to a text configuration file, for 
        easy re-configuration of the system to a different domain: aside from 
        the template contents and the lexicon, the NLG module is 
        domain-independent.</p>

        <p>A template consists of a priority (for comparison with other 
        templates), a number of conditions that must be true for the template 
        to be active and a set of information conveyed by the template, as well 
        as a backward semantic center and a number of forward semantic centers 
        for discourse coherence (inspired by [<a 
            href='http://scholar.google.de/scholar?hl=en&lr=&cluster=13566158086642969293'>Grosz 
            et al, 1995</a>]).  Every time the NLG module receives new facts 
        from the knowledge and affect modules, it attempts to match all the 
        templates to the new knowledge base (this is done automatically by the 
        execution cycle of Jess).  Every template that matches adds a number of 
        candidate utterances to the knowledge base.  Once all templates have 
        been attempted, the system selects a single utterances from all the 
        generated possibilities by first comparing the priorities, and then by 
        random choice, and passes this single utterance to its observers.</p>

        <p>Each template can be matched to a number of "lexicon" entries.  
        Selection of an appropriate lexicon entry (once a template has matched) 
        is done on the basis of the agent's affective state (computed by the <a 
            href='affect.shtml'>affect</a> module.</p>

        <p>The text representation produced by the template NLG system is 
        transformed into spoken audio by the <a 
            href='http://www.nuance.com/realspeak/solo/'>Nuance RealSpeak 
            Solo</a> TTS system.</p>
