Dear Prof. ****************,

As quickly discussed with your personal assistant, it has come to my
attention that there has been unusually high network traffic and
cost, and questionable content, to an Ormond College webs erver.  The
webpages can be seen at the following address;

http://bruce.ormond.unimelb.edu.au

This issue has caused unnecessary load on University facilities, most
likely by those seeking pornography. The webpages can bring the
University into disrepute. Please consider this and respond to me as
soon as possible.
