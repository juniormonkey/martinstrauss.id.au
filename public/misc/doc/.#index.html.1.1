(Ellipses represent modules written at Ormond, rectangles represent
existing packages, and rounded rectangles represent data sources.)
</p>

<a name=ldap>
<h1>LDAP</h1>
<p>
is provided by slapd (at Ormond, we use the University of Michigan's
version, Debian package 'openldapd'). It uses sections of the Ormond
directory strucure, namely it requires users to be members of the
objectclass 'inetAccount', and have attributes 'uid', 'userPassword',
and 'inetstatus'. 'inetstatus' can take three values - 'naughty',
'nice', and 'exempt'.
</p>

<a name=pam>
<h1>PAM</h1>
<p>
authenticates the various proxy services via the pam_ldap module
(provided through the Debian package 'libpam_ldap'). PAM checks the
supplied username and password against LDAP attributes 'uid' and 'userPassword'
respectively, and then checks to make sure that the user's 'inetstatus'
attribute is not set to 'naughty'. If it is, the PAM authentication
fails and the user is unable to access the internet; otherwise, PAM
authenticates the user and they can access the internet.
</p>

<a name=proxy>
<h1>Squid and Dante</h1>
<p>
both provide log output that contains the source
ip, destination ip, username and packet size. These are processed
in real-time by the parsers 'sparse' and 'dparse', which extract this
information and input it into the MySQL database. This is easily expandable
by adding new proxying services and appropriate parsers, so long as
the proxies log all this required information.
</p>

<a name=mysql>
<h1>MySQL</h1>
<p>
contains the download histories and weekly download information
of all users. This is organised in the following tables:
</p>

<h2>'weekly'</h2>
<p>
is the download information of the current week:
<br><br>
<pre>
mysql&gt; describe weekly;
+--------------------+---------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field              | Type          | Null | Key | Default | Extra |

| quota              | decimal(15,2) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+--------------------+---------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
13 rows in set (0.00 sec)
</pre>
The columns represent:
<ul>
<li>username - the user's username
<li>web_last_updated - the time of the last packet that was added to
the totals from the squid parser (time)
<li>socks_last_updated - the time of the last packet that was added to
the totals from the socks parser (time)
<li>tcp_up - tcp uploads through the socks proxy (bytes)
<li>tcp_down - tcp downloads through the socks proxy (bytes)
<li>udp_up - udp uploads through the socks proxy (bytes)
<li>udp_down - udp downloads through the socks proxy (bytes)
<li>last_reset - the time that the record was last reset to zero (time)
<li>web_local - squid downloads from .unimelb.edu.au and .mu.oz.au sites (bytes)
<li>web_mirror - squid downloads from mirror.aarnet.edu.au (bytes)
<li>web_vrn - squid downloads from VRN hosts (bytes)
<li>web_intl - other squid downloads (bytes)
<li>quota - the user's individual quota (dollars)
</ul>
</p>

<h2>$username</h2>
<p>
are a set of tables, one for each user, which record the user's traffic
history:
<br><br>
<pre>
mysql&gt; describe mstrauss;
+-----------+---------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field     | Type          | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+-----------+---------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| date      | datetime      | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| total     | decimal(15,2) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| totalcost | decimal(15,2) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| quota     | decimal(15,2) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+-----------+---------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
</pre>
These tables have columns 'date', 'total', 'totalcost' and 'quota'; 'date'
stores the date of the week for which 'total' stores the total traffic,
'totalcost' the total cost incurred, and 'quota' the weekly quota for
that user.
</p>

<h2>gtotal</h2>
<p>
This table stores the grand totals of all downloads by week (for IT
administrators' records).
<br><br>
<pre>
mysql&gt; describe gtotal;
+------------+---------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field      | Type          | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+------------+---------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| date       | datetime      | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| tcp_up     | decimal(15,2) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| tcp_down   | decimal(15,2) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| udp_up     | decimal(15,2) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| udp_down   | decimal(15,2) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| web        | decimal(15,2) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| web_local  | decimal(15,2) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| web_mirror | decimal(15,2) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| web_vrn    | decimal(15,2) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| web_intl   | decimal(15,2) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+------------+---------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
10 rows in set (0.00 sec)
</pre>
these fields represent the same values as in the table 'weekly', apart from
the 'web' field - this is a legacy field left over from the previous
accounting traffic, where all traffic through the squid proxy was accounted
equally (and thus was consolidated in only one field).
</p>
<a name=knockoff>
<h1>knockoff</h1>
<p>
is a perl script run by cron at a fixed interval (currently
every 10 minutes). It runs through the list of users for whom 'inetstatus'
is set to 'nice', and checks whether their total data transfer cost is greater
than their individual quota (column 'quota' in the database). If it is, then
knockoff sets that user's 'inetstatus' to 'naughty', and they are unable to
access the internet for the rest of that week.
</p>

<a name=reset>
<h1>inet-reset</h1>
<p>
is a shell script that is run by cron at a weekly interval.
It runs three perl-scripts:
</p>

<h2>reinstate</h2>
<p>
finds all the users whose 'inetstatus' is 'naughty' and
resets it to 'nice'
</p>

<h2>reset-all</h2>
<p>
goes through the 'weekly' table and adds up each user's
data transfer total and transfers that to that user's history table.
It then sets all down- and upload records in 'weekly' to zero, and
sets the 'last_reset' to the current date.
</p>

<h2>makegraphs</h2>
<p>
goes through each user's history table in MySQL and plots
a history graph for each user using gnuplot. These graphs are used
on the history website.
</p>

<a name=webpages>
<h1>the webpages</h1>
<p>
are written in php, and constist of two pages: one
which shows a user's downloads since the beginning of the week (that
is, how much of their quota they have used), and one which shows a
user's weekly history since their account was created. There are also
pages for the IT Administrators to view all users' downloads sorted
both alphabetically and by download volume.
